> When listing reasons behind the job cuts on Monday, General Motors tiptoed around trade policy and blamed a host of other factors instead. But the company has been much more direct in its criticism of Trump&#039;s trade war in the past.

>Those who did not update their voter records after receiving the second card were marked as inactive on the state's list of registered voters. Voters who didn't cast ballots in 2014, 2015 or 2016 were then purged from the rolls after the November contest.

https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/329659-indiana-purges-nearly-half-a-million-from-voter-rolls

The part that's not clear here is whether or not both of the above cases had to be true. I assume that they only purged voters who didn't respond as well as haven't voted in 4 years. And I'm also curious what an ""inactive"" status means. I assume it's just a book keeping flag and an inactive voter can still vote until they become purged (from not voting for a long period of time). That seems reasonable to me. Especially when you look at the other points in the article. Like the federal requirement to do exactly this... 

>States are required by federal law to update and correct their voter rolls. But in Indiana, that process was handled almost exclusively at the county level, leaving the task, in some cases, to county offices without the funding or resources to manage the lists.

You can not punish women and children because of other people's actions

>But there is a very real state of war that exists. Gaza's government (Hamas) has been launching attacks on civilians.


And terrorizing Palestinians.  

>That is terrible. While it sucks that Gazan civilians have a harder time crossing into Israel or Egypt, the fault of the war is on the aggressor.

No, it doesn't  merely ""suck"" it's a crime against humanity


>The aggressor is Hamas, a terrorist organization that doesn't hide the fact that they want to kill civilians.


And yet children are punished for the actions of a terrorist organization.  

>If you support Palestinian nationalism, then fine. But realize that support for Palestinian nationalism shouldn't translate into support for extremist groups, like Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

> &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent Lesley Stahl asked DeVos if in Michigan, students who can&#039;t afford to leave public schools are thriving, as the secretary cites.

> White House officials watched the interview, along with media appearances DeVos made on Monday morning, with dismay, two sources familiar with their reaction told CNN. The White House did not respond to a request for an official comment regarding DeVos&#039; performances, and it wasn&#039;t immediately clear what President Donald Trump&#039;s reaction was.

> While DeVos maintained that addressing gun violence in schools is an urgent matter, noting that she&#039;s heading up a task force to observe what states are doing to protect students, Stahl balked, saying &quot;This sounds like talking instead of acting.""

> Schiff and Swalwell&#039;s effort comes as Trump - whose campaign is currently under active criminal investigation for colluding with Putin during the 2016 presidential campaign - is being extremely evasive about what he and the Russian strongman actually discussed during their meeting.

> While Trump remains evasive, Putin told Russian lawmakers that the meeting resulted in &quot;Useful agreements.""

> While it&#039;s unclear what Trump and Putin discussed during their secret meeting, it&#039;s worth remembering that within 24 hours of the two leaders&#039; first private meeting during the G20 summit in July 2017, Trump dictated a misleading statement for Donald Trump Jr. that claimed &quot;a program about the adoption of Russian children&quot; was the reason top Trump campaign officials met with a Russian agent in Trump Tower during the campaign.
