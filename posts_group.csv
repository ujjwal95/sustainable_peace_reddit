Coming of age during the Reagan administration, I've considered myself a Republican most of my life. But now I've been perplexed concerning this new media avenue I've found myself in. Which begets the following questions.

**  Certain boards do not allow articles from certain news outlets. The best example I've found was r/democrats does not allow articles from Fox News or the New York Post. (I'm sure they disallow more and they are not the only board that does this)
 
- - Does this board dictate the same rules? Do you allow articles from all forms of the MSM? 

It seems discussion regarding issues which are polar to a particular board would be welcome and enlightening. Plus, searching for facts or criticism against a particular group allows context and further understanding in one's position. I don't  believe I could bring myself to outright eliminate someone else's views because they don't match my own. 

**  Which brings me to Rule 4 on this board - ""do not post anti-Republican submissions or comments"". 

- -  Can we not question an article or vett an issue published in the MSM even though the article in question is critical of Republican ideas?

It would seem the best place to express ideas, pass on facts or widen understanding of a particular issue would be to post and debate defamatory publications. Every person may align themselves with a specific political idea or party, but each has their own version of morals and scruples. Examining all of those foundations can bring on a topic or view not thought of. 

I thank you all in advance for allowing such a sophomoric question regarding Reddit rules. You help in this matter is greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/9wppzr/in_search_of_clarification/,2,republicans,2018-11-13 17:55:55

[http://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester\_star/commentary-open-forum-proven-leader-mckiernan-unapologetic-in-declaring-not/article\_f2dad2dd-af10-5111-87b4-cfc3bcf5ccc6.html](http://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/commentary-open-forum-proven-leader-mckiernan-unapologetic-in-declaring-not/article_f2dad2dd-af10-5111-87b4-cfc3bcf5ccc6.html)

If this wasn't dumb enough, she is running against ANOTHER WOMAN (although she neglected to mention that), so either way a woman will win. Maybe she can't make a case for herself on policy, or maybe she doesn't care. Either way, I think it is in all of our interests to stop people like this from being elected.

Here is her Republican opponent Debera Taylor's Facebook page. Give her a like or just thank her for running an issues based campaign!: [https://www.facebook.com/Deberataylorfor4thward/](https://www.facebook.com/Deberataylorfor4thward/)

Here is why Debera Taylor is running (policy, not IDpol). You can also donate on the website or volunteer if you live in the area: [https://deberataylorforwinchester.com/](https://deberataylorforwinchester.com/) Please support Debera Taylor (I don't work for her or anything, I just think it's important).

It would be a huge mistake to only care about the Presidency. Don't let SJWs infiltrate local politics. People launch from local, to state, to national politics. Don't let this ideology get a foothold in elected office.

Was always one of the things I strongly agreed with the democratic party on.....


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in 1993: ""The day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is gone. We simply can't afford it.""

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2007: ""I happen to think that the Congress should be spending a lot more time discussing this issue and making it easier for us to create decent paying jobs for American workers instead of allowing corporate interest to drive wages down by importing more and more people into this country to do the work that Americans should be doing.""

Example comment:  Right winger crazies feel safer in their hatred and bigotry now because of the orange leader and they are becoming more outspoken. It’s leading to more violence from the right and they now feel justified in their misplaced anger. Like it’s their time. 

So what I want to ask is: how do you respond to this vitriol? How do you respond to people who place at your feet suffering and death that you had no part in because you lean a certain way?

Would it be more beneficial to make these drugs legal and tax them? We take almost all of the profits away from cartels. Less junkies dying from unclean drugs. More of a chance for junkies to seek help become clean and actually contribute to society. It just seems like we are running in circles and throwing millions of dollars at it.

There's this persistent myth - arguably, outright lie - that George H.W. Bush called supply-side economics ""Voodoo Economics."" In fact, ""**41"" NEVER said that about supply-side economics.** *He was referring to the Kemp-Roth tax cut proposal specifically and many of Reagan's economic policies in general* \- more specifically, Reagan's promise of large, sweeping tax cuts that Reagan argued would end up increasing revenue, at the same time that Reagan was proposing a massive increase in the defense budget.

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edchtf9MS7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edchtf9MS7g)

\^\^Watch this entire clip - but specifically, right about 6 minutes in. Bush says, basically, **""We've got to get the budget in balance by reducing expenditures, get in balance by a $20 billion SUPPLY-SIDE (Bush's emphasis) tax cut, and THEN begin to reduce rates.""** Note that Bush then talks about the perils of endangering investor confidence, being ""already as low at it is"", with ""risking a massive increase in the budget deficit"" - and potentially, even higher inflation. This, more or less, was Bush's view.

As can also be seen in this clip, Bush argued that Reagan was overpromising with his proposals and that Reagan's extremely ambitious plans would unnecessarily increase the federal debt at a time when budget deficits, inflation, and unemployment were ALREADY out-of-control (no thanks to decades of reckless Democrat-driven government handouts, welfare policies, massive federal budgets that were wasteful, unaccountable, and prone to fraud and corruption - culminating in Jimmy Carter's utterly ruinous tenure).

Now, Bush was mostly mistaken in his concerns, from my POV and judging by Reagan's record once in office, but I can totally understand his skepticism from the context of the times; Reagan was indeed taking some massive risks with his plans, but they definitely did pay off in the end, to everyone's benefit! :)

Going back to the title of my thread, though; the broader point is that some sloppy, bad journalism at the time can morph into this myth that Bush actually disagreed with Reagan on most issues, or that he opposed supply-side economics as a rule before he became Reagan's Vice President, or that indeed, ""Voodoo Economics"" was a dig at supply-side economics (which Reagan also subscribed to, obviously), not Reagan's SPECIFIC policy proposals or Reagan's endorsement of Kemp-Roth.

Remember: never trust the conventional wisdom of the liberal elite opinion-makers and myth-makers. This is a good case study of that. They have it out for Republicans and conservatives in general, they want us to fail, and they'll use any piece of ""evidence"" to divide and conquer us - no matter how flimsy or untrue. Always be on guard against them.

The clips are showing large mobs working their way towards US - Mexico border.  
I’m sure many of the pictures are staged as they get them clogging together to cross a bridge or walkway. Always in large mobs. 
Just trying to overload our system and force Administrations hand regarding family separation right before midterms. I find it awfully hard to believe they just got the idea “hey this seems like a good time”.  Interviews have central theme of NO JOBS. Geezus that’s the best they got? 
The optics of which only will benefit the Democrats likely hoping they get separated families.

You are trying to tell me that what's happening to Kavanaugh is better than what happened to Merrick Garland and this is fair.

But I'm not a 20 something gender studies major. I remember what you guys have done.

You tried something AKIN to this on Clarence Thomas.

And failed.

You borked Bork. You tried to libel Thomas.

And you are crying because Merrick Garland was subject to the Biden rule? Who ever brought 11th hour allegations against Merrick Garland? They just didn't consider him. He doesn't need armed guards at his home because there are death threats against him and rape threats towards his children.

https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/02/16/chuck-schumer-supreme-court-nomination-president-sot-erin.cnn/video/playlists/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dead/

There's your boy Chucky Schumer talking about how what happened with Garland was ""policy"".

Look... I knew you were reprehensible when some guy tried to assassinate Republicans on a ball field and you identified with the guy saying, ""What do Republicans expect when they take away healthcare?"" ""I'm surprised it took THIS LONG for someone to try to kill them."" And even, ""Too bad his aim was so bad... we might have the majority if he had killed more of them.""

Auntie Maxine is calling for ""absolutely harassing"" people.

And you blamed Palin for the Giffords shooting because she put a ""target"" on that district. A practice that Daily Kos engaged in when it came to Republicans.

Keep it up Democrats. Just Bork yourselves.

Please note that I do believe Dr. Ford was sexually assaulted. I am not saying she was not.

What I am saying is this: we do need a standard in our society. So if the presumption of innocence only matters and only applies to the court of law. Then what is the standard outside the court of law? Are we to assume everyone is guilty until they can prove their own innocence? Or only assume guilt when it is convenient to ourselves and our own narratives? 

These questions matter. For example: if someone were to call my boss today, and tell them that I raped them should my boss fire me? If they told my friends, should they stop talking to me? If they told my parents should their hearts break and they think that they failed as parents? They they all assume I am guilty unless I can disprove these claims?

It's like watching a little kid eat an ice cream cone, not knowing it's slowly falling off the cone and onto the ground.

It feels like everyone's always wrong no matter what, and I'm not sure I want to live in a world where just voicing my opinion makes people hate me as a person just because it's not their opinion.

Everyone is in essence roasting Kavanaugh on all my social medias, and for all I know he could be a guy getting labeled as a drunk, racist, rapist and his family has to go through that. He has kids, he has a wife and he's been thrown into this. I can't stand that the media seems to be ganging up on him, and instantly believing what just a few people have accused him of.

As a college student (studying film) this horrifies me, especially as I think to my future as a right-leaning American.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/9jgkgy/the_world_is_falling_apart/,9,republicans,2018-09-28 00:48:19

1542669534.0,"Just like how Trump defended Putin in Helsinki, Finland, he's now defending M.B.S. who C.I.A. concluded ordered the killing of Khashoggi. Trump is going against our Intelligence Community's conclusion saying,""M.B.S. completely denies this"", just like what he said about Putin on July 16th.",13,9yhnca,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.9,"I strongly believe that the main reason why Trump is still sticking with M.B.S., the crown price of Saudi Arabia, because of the huge bribes that he possibly have already pocketed from the $110 billion arms deal that he signed last year in Riyadh, the Saudi Capital.

We all saw our most money hungry and a thoroughly crooked president Trump dancing with the swords with the King Salman of Saudi Arabia and kissing a mysterious plastic globe emanating blue light.

I also believe that Trump thinks that if he really has to refund the bribes of $10 or $11 billion, as part of the 10% of the total sum as rumored, from his pocket after the congress scraps the deal, then that loss will break his heart as well as his reputation that he promoted in his 1987 book , ""The Art of the Deal.""

No wonder he's denying now as expressed by Mark Landler in his Op-Ed in today's NYT titled,"" Despite Evidence on Khashoggi, Trump Sticks With the Crown Prince. Why ?""

To Mark's beautifully written piece, I like to add that as Trump is doing now as he often does when he wants a certain topic to go away from the headline, he's denying the fact that the crown prince M.B.S., who incidentally calls him Daddy like another low life butcher called Kim -un -Jung of North Korea, could orchestrate this ghastly murder, ""Because he flatly denied this when I asked him directly over the phone.""

That last sentence coming out of Trump's mouth sounded very similar to what he said for President Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland.

We all recall what Trump said in that infamous press conference on July 16th,"" I've president Putin here who just said it's not Russia. I'll say this, I don't see any reason why it would be Russia.""

As we all recall he said this right after all our intelligence communities led by Dan Coats, the Director of National Security told him with total conviction that it was Russia who interfered in our last election in 2016 which Trump won in his first presidential contest while confronting Hillary Clinton against all odds.

Just like what he said at that time in the press conference in Helsinki, Finland , Trump is completely going against our C.I.A.'s definitive conclusion that M.B.S. ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, an U.S. National and the Washington Post journalist.

To his supporters watching his interview on Fox Tv, Trump expressed his total doubts against our intelligence communities' findings that ""Yes it was M.B.S. who directly ordered the killing.""

In the same interview Trump asked incredulously, ""Will anybody really know ?"" 

As if asking once was not enough, he asked again at the same interview aired on Sunday, ""All right, will anybody really know ?""

1542576009.0,"Trump has to realize that many of his hard core supporters are already rebelling against him by voting for the Democrats in the midterms. If he doesn't change his way of governing,Trump can bet that all his supporters will give the Dems a super majority in congress in 2020 and elect a Dem president.",45,9y5wqz,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.86,"It's true that if Trump thinks his 2020 campaign will be a smoother one compared to his last campaign of 2016, then he's in for a total shock.

With 10% of his hard core supporters voting for the Democrats in the midterms, as Stanley  B. Greenberg stated in his Op-Ed today in NYT titled ""Trump Is Beginning to Lose His Grip"", Trump's campaign for 2020's presidential election looks like it is already heading towards total electoral loss.

With the next sentence, "" It isn't just white suburban women who switched to Democrats. Parts of rural and White working class America peeled off too "", Stan is giving Trump a stark warning of a future laden with nothing but complete failure. 

I really admired Mr. Greenberg's column, so you'll too if you read this latest Op-Ed with various statistics from the recently concluded midterms that clearly told Trump and his cohorts in the Republican party that they will never be able to get out of this humiliating defeat after most of the White unmarried women, white working-class women had chosen the Dem candidates on Nov. 6th along with more White working-class men who voted for more Democrats than what they did in 2016.

As per Stanley, these white working-class women and men who switched to the Democratic candidates in the last election did it because of Trump's bullshit promises that he made in all his first presidential campaign stops but failed to keep them till now.

These White unmarried and White working and non-working class women and men alike are totally disillusioned with Trump's fake promises like,""As a Republican president, I'll never cut your Social Security,  Medicare or Medicaid "" and also, ""I'll repeal Obamacare but provide insurance for everybody"" as Mr. Greenberg quoted him in his Op-Ed, played a big role among Trump's totally disenchanted followers in this recent election cycle.

What's more striking is that Trump's hard core supporters realized for the first time in two years that their messiah knew it all along that he'd never clear the swamp in Washington but turned into a ""swampy president"" himself living in the swanky neighborhood of Pennsylvania Ave.

Although all the current results showed a trend towards a Democratic majority in the congress but what our Dem members have to realize is that ""complacency"" will be our  Enemy No. 1, more than Trump.

Our old and new Dem members of congress have to realize that if they allow such a filthy, obnoxious president any room, Trump will rise up from his slumber and will bite all of them in their heads for sure.

Keeping that thought in their mind, each Dem members of the congress have to stay focused on keeping Trump engaged with clearing up all the swampy mess that he's already created to destroy the very fabric of this country.

Recent killings of two African-Americans in Louisville,KY and 11 Jews in Pittsburgh,PA and sending of 12+ pipe bombs to prominent Democrats by Trump inspired sycophants are a stark reminder that if this president's power is not curtailed, our country will head towards doomsday with Martial Laws dictating the lives of everyone in this country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9y5wqz/trump_has_to_realize_that_many_of_his_hard_core/,7,democrats,2018-11-18 16:20:09

1542556470.0,"A very frustrated Trump might've perjured himself by writing ""NO"" to the question about his knowledge about his campaign's contact with the Russians. He didn't realize that most members of his campaign have confessed to Mr. Mueller saying,""It was Mr. Trump who ordered us to contact the Russians.""",11,9y4bai,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.85,"If Trump has any decency left in him which most of the people in this country doubt, he'd fire his acting AG Mathew Whitaker and give the post to the current Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein.

But since we all know that Trump will not go to the path which'll lead to his impeachment by the new, young and energetic members of the House of Representatives that'll be under Dem control starting Jan 3rd next year, Trump will keep Mr. Whitaker in his unconstitutional and illegal position as long as ""This Russia inquiry, which is nothing but a witch hunt"" goes away as he tweeted yesterday out of total frustration .

The editors in today's NYT had thought about the same predicament when they wrote this editorial saying""Mathew Whitaker and the Corruption of Justice.""

The same editors wrote also this to elaborate their point, ""The real question isn't whether the acting attorney generals's appointment is lawful, but whether it is part of a broader attempt to subvert the rule of law.""

To answer that question I've to say that Trump knows that once his chosen acolyte in the justice dept.Mr. Whitaker is gone he'll lose the ""eye and ear"" of the Mueller investigation which is nearing it's end with charges against Roger Stone and Julian Assange of Wikileaks coming out any time now.

Although Trump has already come to know lot of details about what is in that ""report"" of Mr. Mueller, it's still not too late for the current 49 Dem Senators to force a thoroughly crooked Mitch McConnell to pass the measure to keep the Special Counsel where he is at present that is gathering more evidence against Trump's direct involvement with the Russian hackers to win his one and only election of his life.

I strongly believe that Robert Mueller, who just asked the federal judge not to sentence Trump's campaign aide Rick Gates to any jail time yet until he gives more information about Trump's involvement in the campaign, should be allowed to finish his indictments for the rest of Trump's campaign team including his son Don Jr. His daughter Ivanka Trump. And the indictment of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner who was present throughout that treasonous meting with Putin's confidants in the Trump Tower on June 9th, 2016.

To me Mr. Mueller should also be allowed to name Donald J. Trump as the co-conspirator in the Russian meddling in our last election.

It is not unknown to me that it's a herculean task to make the most corrupted Republican in the Senate, the Majority leader Mr. McConnell who as alleged recently took $3.5 million for his Senate campaign from the Russian oligarchs just like Trump did, to do anything right to tame his president.

We also know this as a fact that even without reading any part of the Muller Commission's report, Mitch knew that Trump campaign was deeply involved with the Russian hackers.

Just like we saw it on tv, Mr. McConnell learnt a lot by listening to the classified report given by Mr. Mueller to the Senate Intelligence committee headed by Republican Senator Richard Burr who had been investigating the Russian influence in our elections from January 2017.

Through that interaction with other Senators Mr. McConnell learnt that 12 members of the Russian counter-intelligence officials working as a team called Guccifer 2.0 were already indicted by the Special Counsel's office for hacking into the Democratic party's and Hillary's home and work related computers as well her Campaign chief John Podesta's campaign related computers.

I'm sure that Mitch knows through the same report like what we saw on CNN and M.S.N.B.C. that Trump is at his wit's end at present.

It is not a secret anymore that Trump is almost puling off his fake hair piece after he read most of the report compiled by the Prosecutors' team which his crooked acting attorney general Mr. Whitaker has just shown him at the White House.

It must be noted here that the same report that Trump just saw at the White House includes all the evidences collected by the Muller's team so far .

No wonder out of sheer paranoia Trump wrote the answers to Muller's questions all by himself without his legal team's input.

Now his lawyers are more than 100% convinced that their president will be in more legal jeopardy after he just perjured himself as they expected to happen for a long time if they allowed Trump to go before the Muller's team.

By writing ""NO"" to Mr. Muller's question of ""Did you ask anybody from your campaign team to contact the Russians ?"", Trump entered a new phase of his legal troubles.

As he convinced himself from the beginning of the Russia inquiry that he'd always deny any knowledge of the Russian collusion no mater what, Trump forgot before writing ""NO"" to that particular question that all his campaign operatives had already confessed to the Special Counsel saying, ""Yes, it was Mr Trump himself who forced us to contact the Russians to hack Hillary's computers.""

Maybe we should stock up on the fireworks for this year's New Year's eve celebration for a Trump free White House starting on January 1st, 2019.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9y4bai/a_very_frustrated_trump_mightve_perjured_himself/,0,democrats,2018-11-18 10:54:30

1542407602.0,Trump is yelling now at everyone in the White House as per a report in CNN. Maybe Mr. Mueller's leaked report on Russia investigation is the reason why Trump is behaving like a real lunatic at present.,14,9xmnsw,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.77,"Yes, if a rumor has to be believed, Trump is more edgy now than he ever was.

Why ?

Because, thanks to his lackey Mathew Whitaker, Trump got wind of all the damning parts in Robert Mueller's report.

No wonder as per some aides, Trump's voice now is blasting through the roof of 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC.

Six or seven of his aides have confided to CNN unanimously that Trump is yelling now at anyone or anything that comes on his way, including his personal umbrella which as we saw last week he just discarded at the steps of AF1 instead of folding it neatly and taking it inside his official aircraft.  

A secret service agent had to run up the long stairs and picked up the poor official umbrella and neatly folded it before taking it inside the plane.

So as Elizabeth Drew has mentioned in her Op-Ed in today's NYT called ""How Trump Is Worse Than Nixon"" and  how ""The current president is pushing closer to fascism than even the man behind Watergate"", we know that another Watergate-like scenario is about to follow up in our country as soon as Mr. Mueller gives his final touches to his report which is due to be finished any day now.

At least we should be happy that this report from the Russia investigation will be handed over straight to the congress , not to Trump's sleazy acting Attorney General Mr. Whitaker.

Ms. Drew also hinted to us through her column today that although Nixon's and Trump's fate is quite similar in nature but Nixon being a political animal knew where the term ""Buck Ends Here"" meant.

But Trump being a political naivete doesn't want to know the term or what it actually meant to many former presidents including President Ike.

That mainly is the reason why he's using all his lung power to yell at his own stooges in his own cabinets trying to shift the blame of his Russian collusion to the Cabinet Secretaries or other staff members working in the White House who were not involved at all in his campaign.

Trump is behaving at present as one of those mentally challenged patients whom their shrinks call,"" Someone who's about to fall off the Wagon.""

Nixon, like Trump, near his end was almost ""falling of the Wagon"" by drinking heavily, cursing at the tv sets in the White House. 

In fact Nixon was so far down with his mental capabilities that his Secretary of Defense was fearful that he might order a nuclear strike on Russia or Cuba.

No wonder Melvin Laird had to order the officers in charge of Nuclear bombs not to launch nuclear missiles without consulting him first or if they didn't find him on the phone then not to hit the famous ""Code Red"" button even if their Commander-in -Chief Nixon ordered them to start a war.

Gen. Mathis may have to do something similar if he finds out that his current Commander-in-Chief Trump is going totally nuts in his head just because Mueller's report is going to come out any day now.

Trump is most worried at present than in his entire life because he probably came to learn through his acting AG that this dreaded report from the Special Counsel will implicate him and his son Don Jr with 'obstruction of justice'.

Our illegitimate president probably came to know  that Mr. Mueller is also going to charge his entire campaign team for abetting and assisting a foreign country in our election process and being accomplishes with crimes under federal election laws and under the federal ""Espionage Act.""

It's my hunch that Mr. Mueller most probably will charge Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner as well for being present in that illegal and dreadful meeting with the Russian oligarchs and that particular Russian Govt's lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in the Trump Tower on June 9th,2016 where Putin's emissaries had shown everyone present there all the 30,000 stolen emails from Hillary's computer . 

And as we learned today that Justice Dept., under Mr. Muller's instruction, is going to charge Julian Assange for publishing those stolen emails on Wikileaks with the assistance of Guccifer 2.0 of Russia's counter-intelligence services who're already indicted and Trump's former campaign hand, Roger Stone who's going to be indicted any day now even before Mr. Mueller's report comes out in the open.

Maybe instead of yelling at his innocent staff members, Trump should start singing Alice Cooper's famous song, ""Welcome to MY Nightmare.""

Ms. Collins was more blunt in her entire column starting with the next line,"" Don and Melania and the gang, doing their thing.""

Like Gail, I also noticed that it would be worthwhile if rest of the Americans like me who compare Trump to a rodent, other than his hard core murderous supporters who follow him from one rally to another like Charles Manson's murderous followers did, could build a wall around him so that he could've his four or five McDonald's hamburgers all by himself without anyone noticing that he's sitting in his hotel room without visiting the cemetery in France where WWI veterans are buried because of a light drizzle outside.

Actually, we Americans have seen so much and heard so much about Trump and all his idiosyncrasies, thanks to all the media pundits who gave him such a free publicity since his announcement for presidency in the month of June, 2015 that if anybody got an award like ""77 Rotten Tomatoes"", it'll be Trump, as the best actor.

Melania, as the best actress with 53 Rotten Tomatoes.

Ivanka, as the best supporting actress with 35.

John Kelly, as the best supporting actor with 28. 

And John Bolton, the best villain ever with 8 minus Rotten Tomatoes.

Maybe we can make another movie called ""The Wall"" based on Pink Floyd's best album with Trump leading the Republican lawmakers' children in a ""Pied Piper"" trail trying to build the wall on the Mexican border after they were broken down.

In the same movie, Trump as the lead actor can carry out sized card board pieces that can be glued together with crazy glue or some other gooey stuff shown in some infomercials.

Because as each day passes, it seems like Trump, a real life version of uncle Ernie a.k.a. Keith Moon from The Who's album and movie ""Tommy"", is set upon on a destructive mode to change not only our national order but the world order as well.

No wonder the promise that Trump made to his junkies and  groupies from his circus like election campaign rallies saying, ""Be sure that I'll build the wall and Mexico will pay for it"", has really  spooked him from which he could never recover from his failure to complete that ""damn Wall.""

And now when he found out that even his Republicans Senators won't approve any money for his ""Bloody Wall"", Trump is at times daydreaming. Other times he's hallucinating that the wall has already been constructed which we know is not true at all.

As per Gail Collins' Op-ED, there are times when Trump is telling his acid tripped ""Deadhead"" like followers, ""See the wall is already built. And it looks beautiful.""

That's him, his allies, his appointees, his bills. This is Republicans. This is Turtle McBitch Face. The midterm is over, it's time to go to war. No partisanship. No mercy. No prisoners. 

They were elected for one specific mission - to send a message to Republicans that while Obama and Dems reached out an olive branch in 2008 we were met with contempt, subterfuge, doublespeak, and plain outright backstabbing. That when the GOP got into power, they abused that power and they certainly weren't interested in playing nice.

The pendulum has swung back our way and Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats need to do the fucking job they've been hired to do. So I'm asking every liberal, every Democrat, everyone who cares about this nation - reach out the every Democratic Representative you can. Remind them of these demands.

Now since his evil plan backfired with Republicans losing, he should send these innocent soldiers home for the Thanksgiving which is only 8 days away.",7,9x0pbk,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.71,"Yes, it was totally criminal on Trump's part to use our brave men and women for this horrible game of using 5,000+ combat troops to stop a caravan of mainly toddlers and their mothers moving at a snail-mail speed towards our southern U.S. border.

Julie Turkewitz and Thomas Fuller have written a similar grim state of affairs by Trump and his leeches when they wrote in their report of the recent California fires that have already consumed 48 lives.

Their Op-ed in today's NYT called "" A Search in Fire-Ravaged California for What No One wants to Find"", these two famed columnists told us what is at stake for the forensic experts, ""to find : bodies and bones."" 

But when we come back to how such a heavy death toll could be averted then we'll find the reason  why  ?

Because Trump the devilish Commander-in-Chief did this illegal troop deployment on our southern border and not in California as soon as the wild fires started there !

He did this horrible act of deploying troops at our southern border only for getting an edge in the last midterms for his Republican cohorts in the congress.

But since those crooked Republicans lost their midterms last Tuesday and will be a minority party in the House of Representatives in the Capitol in Washington DC, Trump could easily send the same brave men and women immediately after Tuesday's midterms to save hundreds of lives in our nation's worst wild fires that destroyed the entire town of Paradise killing 46 residents and 2 more Californians who died in Malibu, California.

It's really sad that with hundreds of Californians who're either near deaths or hurting tremendously physically and mentally from this horrible tragedy, Trump is still keeping our combat troops on the Rio Grande exit points in Texas waiting for a stupid migrant caravan which is hundreds of miles and many months away from our border towns.

And since his evil plan failed to make the Republican House incumbents win the midterms,Trump has completely forgotten about the migrants which he knew from the get go that it was fake or totally man made disaster deliberately made by him and his VP Mike Pence by deliberately not controlling those dictators who're running those 3 devastated central American countries where these innocent children and their mothers are coming from.

It was only Trump and his very evil Republicans who concocted this plan of ""mobs of foreigners"" or ""invading terrorists coming by the thousands at our southern border"" to scare their hard core racist followers and vote for their G.O.P. candidates.

So now if Trump really wants any respect from our brothers and sisters in the armed forces, he should send all our innocent members of our armed forces home for the Thanksgiving which is just 8 days away.

I'm sure that nobody has to remind Trump that this job of stopping the caravan of migrant toddlers and their mothers can be done by our border patrol agents. 

All they've to do is stand behind the concertina wires set up by our experienced members of the armed forces on the Texas border. 

But while resuming my original topic, about the horrible wildfires in California which killed more people there than the last hurricane in Texas, I know I should not politicize a tragedy of this high magnitude that is happening in California even at present as I'm writing this blog, as only 30% of the wild fires contained till this morning.

But I cannot help when I know this current illegitimate president of ours who never did anything right but got involved unnecessarily in only hurling insults to the very people of California who're trying their best to mitigate these wild fires which have already done more damages to the state than any other natural disasters combined together.

No doubt that this current ongoing wild fires in California have caused the huge losses of homes for the ravaged town of Paradise's residents while inflicting total damages to the vegetation in millions of acres of the state of California's fertile land.

So it is one tragedy after another for millions of Californians, rich and poor who've lost everything plus 48 lives of beautiful Americans.

That is the reason why I think we've to cry now more for the families of those victims who tried to flee these raging fires but got caught in the clogged roads and died inside their stalled vehicles or on the forest roads while running from the incoming walls of fire.

And what did Trump say soon after this horrible fires started ?

He right away blamed the people of California for electing his political opponents the Democrats, to run their state's fire mitigating machinery negligently, without even getting a report from the fire officials from that state.

If he had phoned the fire chiefs of Paradise and Malibu of California, he could hear them telling the truth, ""We've never seen a devastating fire of this magnitude in our lives. It is nothing but a natural disaster of the first order, nothing else.""

Go figure !

Actually more than Trump, his Republican cohorts in congress who couldn't keep the House of Representatives in their fold, should be ashamed of going along with their crooked president to keep our brave men and women away from their families at the time of upcoming holidays solely as a political stunt.

Everyone in this country, including his stupid base, knows that Trump did this shameful act of deploying our combat forces only as a political tool so that all the Republican candidates could win their elections at the midterms that just concluded on 6th.

Now as per an editorial in today's NYT called "" Trump Dreams Up Another Immigrant Crisis"" he's throwing up another challenge to the incoming Dem House members by using a 90-day ban on asylum cases for children and their mothers fleeing real violence in triangular countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ruthlessly run by Trump sponsored dictators.

The same editors of NYT also wrote this to display their displeasure of Trump's tactics "" The president turns to an old ploy to justify a new ban on people seeking refuge.""

Just like those editors, I also think that our existing Dem members of congress should orient the new members of the House who're coming this week in Washington about what plan of action our 236+ Dem members of class of 2019 will be taking before this Russia helped president goes berserk.

I think this is totally a disgraceful act for an American president to go so low just to please his equally low followers !

If Trump had any decency left in him, which we know he never had any, then he should at least let our brothers and sisters in the armed forces to go home for the holidays starting with Thanksgiving Day on Nov. 22nd which is less than 10 days away.

The extreme political game, that he played with the phantom ""migrant caravan"" that was not coming near U.S. border until next year, just to increase the number of his voters in the midterms so that they vote for his Republican Senators was a horribly sick political act.

He did that cowardly act as a fake Commander-in-Chief so that he got at least 51 Republicans in the  Senate who'll use their ""No"" votes to save his behind from certain impeachment trial.

He knew jolly well that almost all the 236+ Dem members of the House will vote ""Yes"" for his impeachment in a heart beat, come January next year.

Hope the lawsuit that our beloved A.C.L.U. has just filed in response to Trump's illegal ban of 90 days for any asylum cases prevail in an appellate court .

In the end Trump has to take back this ""newest proclamation"" like he took back his Muslim ban of Feb 2017 after all the appellate court judges nullified his illegal executive action to keep only citizens of 6 poor Muslim countries away from the shores of the United States of America.

In case some Americans didn't hear this, Trump did not ban extremely rich citizens of Saudi Arabia from coming here even though he knew for more than 17 years that it was 16 Saudi nationals who were the same Saudi Royal Govt. sponsored hijackers who brought down our twin towers killing more than 3,000+ Americans by downing 4 planes in New York, Pentagon and Pennsylvania on 9/11. 
Just read the recently declassified ""28 pages"" of the Congressional investigation of 9/11 kept hidden from us for more than 14 years.

And Trump now wants to stand by the same Royal family of Saudi Arabia whose prince just killed an innocent journalist last month in Turkey with the clear voice of one killer telling his superior, ""Tell your boss, the operation is over"" meaning ""Tell M.B.S. Khashoggi's body is dismembered as he instructed.""

Even after listening to the same audio tape that the reporters of the Washington Post listened to yesterday about a concrete evidence of M.S.B.'s direct involvement of the WP journalist's killing, Trump will do nothing to the same ruthless killers of thousands of our citizens and our U.S. national called Jamal Khashoggi because of a $110 billion arms deal he signed with the House of Sauds with his own kickbacks from the deal worth probably in the range of $10 billion by itself.

On *this* planet, 90% of Republicans voted for a Neo-Nazi rather than even passively allow a Democrat to win.  

On *this* planet, Republicans approve more of mass-murdering despots overseas than of the Democratic leaders who are forever desperate to win Republican approval.  

On *this* planet, Washington insiders have been singing the same Song of Surrender ever since Ronald Reagan, turning into solicitous little butlers to every Republican crook who has won or *illegally seized* power since then.  

And the only times we have come back from that is when we started ignoring those parasites and followed common sense - telling the truth because it's the truth, refusing to be cowed by the scum of the Earth, and ignoring the propaganda so we can get on with the business of being a free country.

We elected a two-term President against the wishes of the Beltway, who originally dismissed Obama as some kind of ""radical"" for being even identifiably moral, and they insisted he would never catch on because America's just too conservative.  And that's what they believe: They believe this is a country full of right-wingers (despite all objective evidence to the contrary), and that our own party is a fluke that should keep its head down.

In the course of this campaign, Nancy Pelosi denounced the very grassroots energy that brought us victory as ""incivility,"" and basically told Democrats to shut up.  Because, in her demented ""Man in The High Castle"" alternate universe America, we lose when we speak up.  When we all know it's the exact opposite, as the results proved.  

Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and a few other long-sitting (but rarely *serving*) Beltway leaders [live in their own little world](https://www.gq.com/story/chuck-schumer-and-nancy-pelosi-oh-god) that is not only oblivious to the reality of our party and country, but seem to have a Munchausen-by-proxy relationship with its fortunes.  

They take power in voter revolts they did little or nothing to enable, or even actively try to discourage; blunt and sabotage attempts to build on victory, as well as other leaders who actually try to lead; constantly advocate collaborationism and surrender to the Republican Party, no matter how shrill and destructive it (and their kowtowing to it) becomes; and just constantly betray us.

And for whatever reason, their delusional Loser rhetoric is being pumped up here, after our **victory**, and arguments to the contrary being *systematically* suppressed and attacked.  Make no mistake, 2018 was not just a revolt against Trump - it was also a revolt against everyone who bows to him and his Party.  

We do not ""work with"" Nazis and traitors, and we do not ""seek cooperation"" with people holding guns to our heads.  And the reason we don't is because it **obviously** doesn't work.  It never did.

I defy anyone to give me a single instance in the past **forty years** where appeasement of the Republican Party worked to our favor.  Give me one, single time where groveling before the GOP was rewarded by voters for its ""magnanimity"" and ""patience"", when voters sympathized with Democrats for being betrayed.  

There is none.  

#NEVER...HAPPENED.

**We win when we fight.  We lose when we don't.  Period.**

In a way, ReTrumplicans are correct, however before attending their first class students are already self-selected as willing to learn and curious about the world. That caveat aside, there is a clue here to reaching the communities of non-attenders.

Higher education exposes the student to logic and the scientific method. Once exposed they can see for themselves how fiercely ideas are challenged and proofs tested for years before emerging into public.

&#x200B;

This is the foundation of confidence in science and fact.

This is why it is indisputable that women and minorities are as capable as white men.

This is how we know human-induced global warming is a fact.

This is why we understand that 'trickle down' economics do not work.

This is how we come to accept a common reality where the debate is about how to handle or prioritize an issue, not whether it exists.

&#x200B;

By investing in quality education for our fellow citizens we can introduce them to logic, math and the scientific method from middle school on. We do not have to challenge local beliefs about God, society or history. Just give young people the tools to think clearly and methodically through problems.

1542061847.0,Trump has made most of the Americans abundantly worried about stuff that are mundane. His perpetual lies are making more than half of the Americans going insane. Hope our citizens don't have to suffer any longer.,14,9weh28,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.79,"It is true that there are very few Americans who actually can feel the depth of the water that we're currently swimming in or sinking whichever term seems appropriate here.

That's why I think Charles Blow's Op-Ed in today's NYT was just right when he told us, ""You've Have a Right to Weariness.""

Charles was equally vocal in his next line where he wrote,"" The struggle for goodness and decency is an eternal struggle, not a seasonal one."" 

While appreciating Mr. Blow's comments, I also have something to add on to his column.

I strongly believe that Trump is driving all of us insane when he comes up with some outrageous lies everyday. Every moment we all think maybe those lies will end sooner or maybe those current lies will be his last.

But just the next day or maybe the next moment, he comes up with another horrendously stupid lie.  

Being really good Americans we again give him a benefit of doubt and say with a collective shrug, ""This is it. There cannot be a worse lie like that. This is the epitome of the man's barbarism.""

Lo and behold, he then comes up with another outlandish lie next moment saying ""It's not just a caravan of only migrant children and women that the liberals are telling us, it has some very dangerous people from the ""middle-east"" who're going to blow up our buildings like they did on 9/11.""

And his acolytes at Fox Tv. even beams up the images of a few well bodied south Americans among the 7,000 + migrants of mostly central American mothers and their toddlers and say ""See our president is right. Those men are not from Honduras or El Salvador or Nicaragua that Mexicans are telling us. They're I.S.I.S. soldiers from Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.""

No wonder with the pronouncement of perpetual lies from the morning hosts of his favorite tv. channel, Trump told Gen. Mathis to send 15,000+ soldiers to our southern border with Mexico.

Even now when the midterms are over where his Republican party lost almost everything including the House and many state Capitols and Governors' mansions all over the country, our fake commander-in-chief has no intention to send those brave men and women home for the Thanksgiving that he'll be celebrating with his equally crooked family members.

As for these poor U.S. combat soldiers are concerned, they'll be celebrating all the upcoming holidays in dimly lit tents eating prepackaged meals.

So even after watching Trump's total abuse of power, if our citizens give him another chance in 2020, then only God can help us, not this son of the Devil or maybe we can call Trump the Devil himself who likes to wear a very long and wide red tie held together only by a piece of clear scotch tape.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9weh28/trump_has_made_most_of_the_americans_abundantly/,0,democrats,2018-11-12 17:30:47

1542056485.0,Discussion on the way forward with the new House.,5,9wdtez,t5_2qn70,democrats,Cyeric85,0.73,"So, I have been talking and debating with my fellow veterans and citizens on what the Democrats should be pushing for in the next year. 2020 is around the corner and I thi k a more exact strategy is needed in order to negate or limit any losses in 2020 and 2022.

I belive the way to win back people and make sure the turnout this year is again present in 2020 and 2022 is to focus on things the Republicans cannot afford to vote down. I'll list them here and hopefully we can have a discussion. I encourage all to participate even the libertarian and conservative lurkers.

1. I think first in the docket is MAJOR campaign finance reform. We can all agree that corporate money in government is the root of a lot of reforms being shot down.

2. New corruption laws and standards of conduct for elected officials.
 Along with that new lobbying laws and systemically erasing ""dark money"".

3. Overturning Citizens United, I believe left or right we all know this is the root of corruption in the government.

4. Giving the ethics committees a lot more power in order to investigate ethics violations and increase funding and personell.

5. Rolling back some of the Tax Reform of last year and bringing the deficit under control. Also extending the middle class breaks further into the future and rolling back or placing a termination date for the corporate tax rate. I find the original plan of 26% to bring it in line with other countries viable.

6. Order a re-evaluation of the way the DoD does its military contracts, the system is full of fraud waste and abuse and needs to be fixed.

7. Fix the VA problems and redesign their infrastructure in order to serve veterans more effectively and if needed aquire more funding.

8. Get an infrastructure bill that will help states repair thier roads and bridges among other things.

9. BALANCE THE BUDGET! Or get as close as we can with a deficit reduction.

10. Last one is VERY specific and why it's last and has the highest potential to screw us in the next elections. 

 Gun control needs a very focused approach with small bills and phrases to existing laws and systems.
 
A) making the background check system a nation wide system with mandatory reporting from agencies and the military.

B) Having the CDC and other research agencies study the impacts of gun control/less control and the effectiveness of any weapons bans.

C) once the research is finished adapt the current federal regulations to increase the effectiveness of gun control laws.


These are just a few ideas I have been thinking about for a couple weeks before the election. If we tailor our proposals and laws around areas that they would get hammered in if they vote no on I think we have a good chance of winning and winning often.

I also want to make a point that we need to open dialog back across the isle, the demonization and muddy politics has got to stop, we were able to do so much back in the early days because we debated and listened to each other for the express goal of making the United States the shining beacon of freedom and democracy. We need to return to that regardless of how we want to get there.

Not in U.S.A where he'll be impeached by our Dem led congress for sure.,7,9w43ba,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.72,"Yes, it will be too stupid on Trump's part not seeing the power of our newly won Dem members of congress who'll take control of the congress after Jan. 1st next year.

If Trump thought he was invincible then this past midterms should wake him up from his slumber and tell him softly in his ear, 
""Buddy, your time as president is up. Look for an escape route from the White House and maybe find refuge in Timbuktu or become a leader in a banana republic where your hateful rhetoric might work. Not in the United States where you'll be impeached by the new Dem led congress for sure.""

Actually only a true moron like Trump who failed to notice that the resistance to his monarchy was coming. 

Like a total idiot he really thought he was like one of  the monarchs of England where they got to stay in the ivory palaces all their lives.

The only difference is that he wants more power than the current monarch of England, Queen Elizabeth who's only a ceremonial head of state who's allowed to declare England's parliament open, nothing else.

Now with the win of the first African-American contender from the Dem party in a totally White constituency, our new House representative called Lucy McBath who won in the same Sixth District of Georgia that the D.N.C. contender Jon Ossoff lost just a year and a half before as Michelle Goldberg stated in her Op-Ed called ""The Resistance Strikes Back"" in NYT today, Trump should fear the power of all the Democrats' renaissance or the tools of resistance to his power that the entire left leaning parties have perfected since his unlawful election in 2016. 

Ms. Goldberg also warned Trump about a strong resistance plus a very strong possibility of him being impeached by the new Dem majority congress with the blue wave spreading all over country including all the red states.

Ms. Goldberg narrated a fine example of that wave when she wrote about a new mother called Erin Zwiener who won the state house seat in Austin, Texas as a Democrat which was unthinkable thirty years back. 
 
Every Democrats should know that Ms. Zwiener went on campaigning with her new born baby after going on labor while protesting against Trump's baby snatching or family separation policies.

And Erin was ""one of the 12 Texas Democrats to flip state House seats and two other Texas democrats flipped 2 state senate seats as well"" as per Ms. Goldberg's Op-Ed.

We Democrats should really be proud of these members like Ms. McBath and Ms. Zwiener who're among the nationwide Democrats who ""flipped at least 333 statehouse seats, a third of all those lost over the course of Obama's presidency"" as per Michelle'a account. 

But these two wins, one in Georgia for a congressional seat in Washington and the other one for the state house of Texas, were too sweet to ignore.

12 state house Dem members who won their seats along with two Dem state Senators who won in the State of Texas is itself a record for a totally red state's history.

No wonder Michelle warned Trump again by saying that he should be prepared for more resistance that is coming against his rule by reminding him with this sentence in her piece, "" Two years of progressive organizing built the blue wave.""

While applauding Michelle's column, I also like to remind Trump that he should know by now that except for his couple of millions of hard core supporters, every Americans from all walks of life have a strong opinion that some form of hanky-panky went on while he was running for the first election of his life.

It didn't escape no one's attention in America that Russia played a crucial role in Trump's bid for the White House.

Trump can be sure that our newest Dem members of congress will find the truth by calling each and every members of his campaign team again even though Mr. Mueller had done it once and is writing his final report at present.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9w43ba/trumpll_be_too_stupid_not_to_notice_the_power_of/,1,democrats,2018-11-11 17:17:56

1541916484.0,Educational and political establishment should do much more in communities with high violence,3,9vyd5c,t5_2qn70,democrats,freethinker78,0.81,"A female student hit a teacher in the face in Baltimore. According to at least a comment in a news site, this is a regular occurrence. The school system and the political establishment for some reason have failed to stem the violence in communities. One has to ponder why is this? Are there too many people who commit violence that are not educated in the communities? Do educational and political authorities have a comprehensive plan to stem the violence? Is there a chronic lack of sufficient resources? Whatever is happening needs to change. It is not possible that high violence levels get to be accepted as something normal in these communities. There should be a complete assessment of the situation in these communities, the factors at play, what role can schools and government play in cutting off the vicious cycle of violence, what resources do they need, be provided with enough resources, and workers and officials who can be role models and be competent enough to conduct their tasks.

A few suggestions dealing with violence in schools:

1. Any student found guilty of physically attacking another person in an unacceptable manner should be jailed for seven days in solitary confinement. Jailing a student to socialize with others in jail is actually counterproductive because in such environments, the most violent inmates are the ones most popular and respected, so the violent tendencies of the students are actually just reinforced.
2. After the seven days, the student should be assessed by a mental health team and be treated if need be for a limited period of time (psychiatry is prone to abuse sadly, so it must be limited), with methods that don't infringe upon the human rights of the student, and which include anger-management and conflict resolution classes. If the student gets to be an inpatient, the student should not be held for more than a month.
3. Release the student with probation of two years.
4. Monitor said student for a period of six months after release.
5. Give incentives to the student not to be violent.
6. Address domestic or external issues that may turn the student violent, such as violent parents, violent siblings, violent people in the street or in the classroom.
7. Acquaint the students of the consequences of attacking another person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9vyd5c/educational_and_political_establishment_should_do/,1,democrats,2018-11-11 01:08:04

1541897275.0,"Trump is very much like King Henry VIII, in terms of bad temperament and other aspects.",6,9vvrct,t5_2qn70,democrats,TheLordIsMyDefender,0.63,"Trump has parallels to certain authoritarian rulers, particularly to Hitler and Stalin. However the one that stands out most is King Henry VIII.

Both Trump and Henry VIII

1) Marriage Infidelity with several wives (this is a superficial point though it must be said).

2) Known for bad temperament (Henry VIII was great in his prime unlike Trump though). Both individuals are known for their respective rages.

3) Had a very careful father who was skilled and has not lived up to his expectations (Fred Trump and Henry VII were both exceptionally financially skilled and created an empire in the hopes that their sons would expand this, alas in both cases the empire was squandered). Whatever else Hitler and Stalin were they were most definitely self-made men, unlike Trump and Henry VIII.

4) **Prized loyalty to them above all else.**  This is perhaps the main key point. Henry VIII and Trump both hate other powerful individuals. Henry VIII for instance loathed the aristocracy because he couldn't make them his own. So Henry VIII went for individuals he could make from lower classes. As he expected they would have total loyalty to him because he had given them everything and could take it away. 

5) Fundamentally define a person's value as being how useful they are to them. Henry VIII loved Thomas Moore like a brother until Moore refused to confirm Henry VIII's divorce. Trump will love Paul Manafort until Manafort strikes a deal with the FBI against Trump.

1541883351.0,"Since the midterm elections are over, let's talk about impeachment again. If Trump doesn't remove the acting AG from his job, we should impeach Trump, Whitaker and Brett Kavanaugh too for lying under oath that he was never there in that ""house"" in Maryland in 1983.",10,9vu2yc,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.73,"Yes, since all the midterms elections are over, let's put the i-word forward again.

The contagious word ""Impeachment"" that we on the left were keeping in the back burner, let's bring it forward out in the open and say in collective tone, ""Impeach Trump"" first.

And if he doesn't do the right thing in withdrawing the appointment of his stooge in the Justice Dept., let our new Dem members insist on impeaching Mathew Whitaker too for taking up his job as the acting AG by auditioning for his job via CNN hinting to Trump directly through his tv interview that he'd fire Mueller if he held the job of AG. 

No wonder Trump appointed a crooked man knowing the acting AG is under F.B.I. investigation for being on the board of a company called ""World Patent Marketing which was shut down in May by a federal court in Florida because it was a business scam"" as per Bret Stevens in his Op-ed in today's NYT called ""A Trump Hack Hacks Justice.""

Bret also wrote in his piece that "" If Whitaker does not recuse himself from the Mueller inquiry, Democrats should impeach him.""

As per Miami New Times, Whitaker ""wrote at least one bullying email to a customer who threatened to complain to the Better Business Bureau about the company's business practices.""

As per the same source,"" Mr. Whitaker served as a paid board member of a company "" that scammed millions of investors .

And last but not least we should impeach Kavanaugh for lying in front of all the Senators and the entire country that he was not present in that party in that dreaded home in Maryland where Dr. Ford testified under oath that she was sexually molested by two inebriated males, Brett Kavanaugh and his drinking buddy Mark Judge.

How we got back to impeaching Trump again ?

Because we knew that the moment our Dem members talked earlier about impeaching Trump, he took it straight to his voters saying, ""Vote for my Republican colleagues if you don't want to see your president get impeached.""

Now that brings us to the most important question : If Trump didn't do anything wrong, why was he so worried about the term, ""Impeachment"" ?

The fact is that Trump knew that he did something wrong, something very terrible to get himself elected as the president.

Even the ordinary citizens like us heard Trump in a press conference in 2016 at his golf club in Doral, Florida, ""Russia, if you're listening, please find those 30,000 missing emails from Hillary's computers.""

Now the question comes, why did he ask Russian hackers to find those emails when we had thousands of young  and brilliant computer experts who could dig up anything that our intelligence officers asked them to dig up from any computers.

There was only one reason for Trump's pleading with the Russians: He was indebted to Russia for still some known and unknown reasons.

All our retired intelligence officials like John Brennan, James Clapper, Michael Hayden, James Comey et Al are quite convinced, some with 100% accuracy that Russia's Putin had some highly incriminating evidence against Trump and he used those tapes to blackmail then candidate Trump.

After seeing Trump defending and trusting Putin's words in Helsinki, Finland summit saying ""My country Russia did not interfere in U.S. elections"" and disregarding his own intelligence community's findings that ""Yes, they did"", we know that Trump is still being controlled by Russia's Putin who put his own slave in our White House.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9vu2yc/since_the_midterm_elections_are_over_lets_talk/,1,democrats,2018-11-10 15:55:51

However, we lost 3 Blue Seats in 3 Red states.  And that's why we didn't take the senate.  The numbers were already against us with so few Republican seats even up for reelection.  Let's face it, Donnelly, Heitkamp and McCasskil were always going to have an uphill climb.

Myself, and a lot of Democrats on here, cautioned that vulnerable Dems shouldn't vote against Kavanaugh.  That we though he was scummy, but vulnerable dems in red states needed to be strategic, because possessing the Senate had to be the ultimate goal...especially with the uphill road we had.   We said if they could turn the tide on Kavanaugh, then they must, but since they couldn't, they should keep their head down.

They have no spines!  They never fight back!""  ""This is just corporatist Dem Talk!  We need a revolution!  All you old fucks should just step out of the way and give someone else a chance to lead!""  ""We don't need McCasskill, fuck her!  She's an establishment Dem! We need to replace her with an our revoultion candidate!""  ""I hope Heitkamp loses!  Fuck her.  She once took a picture with Hillary!""


Yet, here we have the 3rd set of elections in a row where Progressive far left candidates didn't actually win a lot of seats.  Almost none actually, with a few exception.  But Centrist Democrats, like Manchin, held on to their seats in Red States with no problem.  It's almost as if You need a candidate that matches your district if you want to win?

Which is not to say that People like Beto did not greatly affect down ballot races.  Many seats flipped in texas from red to blue because Beto-mania drove voters to the polls.  But ultimately, Beto lost.  We didn't get a Senate seat that we desperately needed.  He came so close that I could taste it, but he lost.

I guess what I am saying is, at what point can the far left and the ""progressives"" stop beating their fists against a wall and feel good about it because they are ""taking a stand"".  At what point can they respect that ""old fucks"" like Pelosi, who have seen more than 2 elections (have actually lived and survived multiple elections in fact) have valuable skills and life lessons to teach us?  That we should stop with the purity tests and shitting on people that are more moderate than you?

In all the Bernie sub reddits, I have checked, the rewriting of history is insane.  They are already saying the reason that we didn't take the Senate is because Dems are evil and must be destroyed.  Ocasio-Cortez is already saying that it's sad that Dems are only the party of Gay rights.  That Dem's suck on women's issues.  That we lose because we are not ""bold"" enough.

https://www.vogue.com/article/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-interview-vogue-november-2018-issue

And it's so fucking frustrating because Bernie and Ocasio-Cortez live in a fantasy world where they never really have to worry about being kicked out of office by Republican voters or Independent voters.  From their safe perches they shit on everyone else like McCaskill....who, unlike them, is in an unbelievable red state.  They ignore poll after poll where voters straight up say ""They lost my vote over Kavanaugh"".  They just assume ""Oh, we would have won if Bernie ran in Montana"".  

It's just extremely frustrating.  With the map against us...we could have turned the Senate.  Republicans had 42 seats not up.  We were so behind the 8 ball.  and yet if we had kept those 3 seats...which we EASILY could have done if the progressive wing of the party was pragmatic....then we could have won the Senate.

I don't have a magic 8 ball.  I don't know what *would* have happened.  No one does (although I am sure the far leftists will chime in and tell me they absolutely know what would have happened).  

But at the end of the day.  Those 3 seats...plus Florida and Arizona...we would have won the Senate.  No more judges for Republicans.  No more scares with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and praying she can hold on for 2 more years.  No question that Mueller would be protected.  The Donald Trump Presidency would be over.


I think That having Donald Trump be a complete Lame duck for the next 2 years was a FUCK ALL LOT MORE IMPORTANT than moderate dems having to ""prove"" themselves to progressives by voting against a man that was being confirmed anyway.

When you draw a line in the sand...it would sure be nice to have something to show for it. That's all the moderates have been trying to tell you for the last 2 years.  We agree with you on SO much.  But we believe in moving Strategically.  And you believe that if you don't fight, even symbolically, on every issue, then you have failed the ""cause"" somehow.

There is something to be said for leaving gas in the tank, and living to fight another day.  We had a chance to lame duck Donald Trump...and we lost it.  And you think we lost it because we didn't go far enough left.  

We lost it because we are a party divided..where left leaning progressives and younger voters demand symbolic actions.  And the right doesn't do that, they fall in line.  We could learn a lesson from them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9vmv4t/so_can_we_discuss_strategy_and_how_requiring/,4,democrats,2018-11-09 21:20:22

Each and every Americans think that he appointed his stooge Mr.Whitaker to destroy the evidence from Mueller's Russia investigation.",9,9vlgym,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.64,"It really seems like everybody around Trump are mere showpieces  or just minions with no vocal strength to express their own opinions against Trump's illegal and unconstitutional activities.

Yes, take it from me that everybody in Trump's inner circle has no guts to tell his or her president that , "" Sir, you're absolutely wrong, in this case of appointing an acting AG without a Senate confirmation.""

Richard Ben-Veniste and George Frampton has told us what we wanted to hear that "" Mueller Has a Way Around Trump and His Minions."" 

These two distinguished Watergate Prosecutors also informed us a very important information as how Mr. Mueller can avoid sending his report to Trump's stooge Mathew Whitaker but send his findings straight to  the Senate and the House judiciary committees now or to the new congress in January next year.

These two thoroughly true American heroes informed us the road map of going directly going to the congress bypassing the acting AG through their Op-Ed in today's NYT saying "" A road map from the Watergate prosecution shows a potential route for the special counsel to send incriminating evidence directly to Congress.""

Just like these two gentlemen, there are two more true patriots called Neal K. Katyal and George T. Conway III who scolded Trump pointblank by saying in their OP-Ed in today's NYT saying this ""Trump's Appointment of the Acting Attorney General Is Unconstitutional.""

These two lawyers were more blunt in their next line by saying, ""The president is evading the requirement to seek the Senate's advice and consent for the nation's chief law enforcement officer and the person who will oversee the Mueller investigation.""

President Obama's acting solicitor General Mr. Katyal and a litigator in New York Mr. Conway quoted Justice Clarence Thomas, whom none of us on the left like.

Mr.Thomas, who listened in the S.C.O.T.U.S. about a similar case regarding the appointment of a general counsel in the National Labor Relations Board, stated his views very clearly about who a ""principal Officer"" of the country is. 

 Justice Thomas had explained in his opinion piece about the status and the roles of our ""Principal Officers"" in our country as  two distinguished lawyers quoted in their piece.

As per Mr. Thomas, Mathew Whitaker would perfectly fit the profile of such an officer as set by the dissenting judge.

So as per the way Justice Thomas's dissected  the confusing word, the Principal Officer of the current Justice Dept. Mathew Whitaker who'll answer to no boss except the president, the acting AG's appointment should be guided by the congress.

Yes, as per Mr. Thomas's judgement, the Senate must give okay to Mr. Whitaker's appointment with 51 votes as per the current Republican controlled Senate's standard set by their crooked majority leader, Mitch McConnell.

So by all circumstantial evidences that we've at present like the forced retirement of Jeff Sessions and the immediate appointment of his chief of staff to the post of AG, Trump has committed an infraction of the law as per our constitution when he illegally bypassed three other highly eligible officers in the current Justice Dept. and appointed someone who's totally unqualified for the AG's job. 

By appointing Mr. Whitaker on the basis of his opinions against the Russia investigation which he expressed to Don Lemon of CNN two months back and to other anchors clearly stating that ""Muller's inquiry should be starved of money so that it folds up on it's on without any funds available"", Trump has proved that he has a lot of skeletons to hide in his closet regarding his collusion with Russia's GRU unit.  

I bet that given free rein to Mr. Mueller, we'll find that all the evidences that the Special Counsel has collected so far will take us towards some criminal who has committed a crime of ""Treason"" .

And that criminal is the current chief occupant of our White House who is also a real con man and a snake oil salesman called Trump, the slick willy.

While ending my case against Trump with straight forward answer, I can also phrase my statement with another question asking, ""If Trump thought he had nothing to do with the Russian collusion, why didn't he promote Rod Rosenstein as acting AG ?

Your guess is as good as mine : Because Trump knows he's guilty as hell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9vlgym/if_trump_doesnt_get_rid_of_acting_ag_even_after/,2,democrats,2018-11-09 18:43:17

1541755989.0,"Why do I strongly believe Republicans are ""bad?""",7,9vg4sh,t5_2qn70,democrats,Gothboi777,0.62,"TL;DR I really dislike the Republican Party. They seem to all be selfish, rotten meat heads that only care about themselves.  Am I wrong in that assertion? Anyone else feel the same way? Differently? 

&#x200B;

This is something I've been thinking about. I have been voting since I turned 18 in 2008. Voted For Obama twice, and even though I didn't particularly like her, I voted for Hilary. Definitely would have preferred to be voting for Bernie Sanders, but what can you do? Voted a blue ticket in the midterms and even helped my local congressman's campaign.

&#x200B;

I've noticed in my life, and especially since moving to a very conservative district, that I just don't get along with republicans. I don't know what it is. Their personality is neandethalic. They're all macho meat heads that are full of anger and want to complain about taxes. They're all entitled and want to live some cookie cutter life and anything that deviates from that is considered weird. They all have an obsession with ""work."" I have nothing against hard work, I'm very dedicated to the work I do, but they have this dichotomy between noble blue collar work and evil white collar work. I'm grew up and ended up a very stubborn democrat, and my brother on the other hand is a very stubborn republican. 

&#x200B;

I just think about most republicans I know, and they just seem to have a personality flaw. But I'm sure we look the same way to them. I see things like more educated and wealthier people are more likely to vote democrat, and the middle class is more likely to vote republican. And I've noticed that, and thats what I don't get. It is like republicans have their anger at the wrong people. They worship the ultra wealthy, and blame the poor for their problems, when it is really large corporations like Walmart that suck the prosperity out of communities. But people who vote republican seem to love Walmart.

&#x200B;

They also don't understand alternative lifestyles like veganism or other religions and stuff. It is as if they all want nothing but christians that kill animals and pollute the waters and tear down nature. They will say no to solar and wind energy, but are all for fossil fuels and coal. I feel so silly because all I can think is how dumb they are, but I can't put my finger on a coherent argument.

There are several channels on Youtube that aim at millenials and boomers using SJW ""fail compilations"" to present Liberals as idiots and cause a disgust among independent voters that later vote Republican.
These channels are: PragerU, Hunter Avallone, Mark Dice. 
There is nothing special about them, they are regressive and pretty stupid but they have Alex Jones type of influence on people but Alex Jones is gone from the internet and these hateful brainwashers aren't.

Youtube is an important platform for millenials, Gen Z and even boomers. When I go see Pro Trump video majority of comments are Republican. When I go see Pro Liberal video, majority of the comments are Republican. People always read comments, they see bunch of Pro Trump comments, they get discouraged and think ""Hey, maybe Trump is right"" or ""Hey, maybe there's too many of Republicans so my vote won't matter"".. 
I only saw like 2-3 videos ridiculing Trump supporters. 

* Midterm elections
You decided to launch a campaign where no senator competitor would have any attack ad which is pretty stupid.. 
Take a look at Martha McSally. She found video evidence of Kyrsten Sinema calling Arizonan women leeches, she cut the video edited and now she leads by 17000 votes. Martha McSally lied about deaths of her colleagues and Sinema never used it against her even though Veterans were witnesses.
Currently, Martha McSally and GOP of Arizona filled a lawsuit to throw away 500000 minority ballots that would favor Kyrsten but neither CNN nor ABC are reporting about this, even though this would cause a huge resistance.

Beto was the best choice to turn Texas blue but yet you failed to run ads where Trump calls him a liar, says his father murdered JFK and then add a cut where Ted is kissing up to him. This would probably cause a disgust among Texans. You led a clear harmless campaign and lost.

Maybe it's just some observations, a rant, rambling, or an abstract of my opinions.   I dislike that our country is being run the way it is, and embarrased for the US in how we treat our allies.  I wish the other major party (D) would get their crap together and fix it.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I feel like I have a very good understanding of the Republican message, but I don't understand the Democratic message anymore.   It seems they care about all the special interests and groups; fighting the patriarchy, black rights, hispanic rights, feminism, gun control, anti-abortion, gay marriage, what have you etc.  The Trump vein of the republican party is so poorly operated that this should be easy to demonstrate they are dangerous to the country, but all I see out of the Democratic party is the same party positions from 2016. 

For example, my state is voting very very very republican outside of the major metro areas.  Claire McCaskill lost by +15 to +30 points in most counties across Missouri.  According to the Census Bureau's statistics on registered voters, the only thing that is really common in these counties is that they are 97% white.  There are also approximately 20% of the population living below the poverty line and the next 30% aren't doing all that hot either (sub $50k household income).  

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-missouri-elections.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-missouri-elections.html)

I know in this neck of the woods, people are actually more of a libertarian/slightly conservative bent.  The majority of people actually do see reason, have endorsed liberal policies in the past, and would follow the candidate of the party that supports the right message.  It's just the Democrat's message has changed (and been influenced) by political posturing from the Republican party that hasn't been adequately refuted.  Is this the message that works on the coasts?   It doesn't work in Missouri....

Claire performed terribly across most counties because quite frankly, she is a rich woman from the suburbs, female, has been aggressive on gun control, and not viewed as a dyed in the wool Missourian.  She has spent the last two years trying to act like a republican (voted to approve ajit pai for example) so she can keep her job, which only angered middle-of-the-road voters.   She is painted as the epitome of a special interest ring leader, and when most of the people in those counties don't fit in those special interests, well guess what, they vote republican.  Even if it's a slack jawed lawyer that talks fast and they know very little about (Hawley's message was basically ""I ain't Claire, vote for me"").  He should have been easy to beat. 

The ""alt-right"", ""right"", ""nationalist whites"", ""republican base"", ""trump voters"", whatever you want to call them, are still pissed.  They are; on average - modest to poor income, live in a rural area, work blue collar jobs, hunt (own guns), somewhat religious, and try to be good people.  They do know that a lot of blue colar jobs have been lost, and fortunes created by the few by the robust trade with China (which are communists btw - who do not share any of the same values as Americans when it comes to honest business).   They aren't interested in having their gun rights restricted, because people far away and from the political classes tell them they should because nut jobs are doing terrible things.  They know they have it hard, but they soldier on and make the best of their lives in spite of the government.  They don't give a crap about Saudi Arabia or some ex-royal advisor turned journalist that got dismembered.  He probably had it coming.  They don't have much of a retirement, couldn't care less about the middle east, north korea (other than to opine that we are annoyed and someone ought to straighten little stumpy out because we're sick of his shit), and are focusing on raising their kids the best they know how.  They feel like blacks and women have equal opportunity (and in some cases more opportunity) than they do to get an education and be successful.  They just think those speical classes haven't given up their fight, and are now fighting for equality of outcome instead of simply opportunity - which is not popular.  They hate only being able to afford shopping at Walmart, can't really afford a babysitter anymore, for some reason they pay almost as much in day care costs to the one teacher that has 20 kids in her class as they make in a month, despise the fact that we're monitored online and in public, despise the notion that they can't raise their children with some discpline anymore without fear of some nosy bob haircutted mom will call CFS on them, and costs for everything else keep going up while their wages stay the same.  They've seen the results of progressivism for the last 30 years, and they don't like it.  They aren't stupid.  

The Trump message has hit a jackpot because they say ""We hate special interest groups.  We're all americans, and no one should get special treatment.  We respect you, understand it's been tough, and want to fight to make your life better.  We don't want to be telling you you have to buy health insurance you can't afford.  Rich people are screwing you, getting richer, and your lives aren't improving at all.  It ain't fair!""   This message is portrayed to be genuine, understanding and inspiring.  It's obvious no amount of stupid (scandals, political posturing, trade snafu's, tariffs, border wall nonsense) can make these voters go ""wow, this is pretty bad - i need to just vote for the democrats who don't care about me"".    Most of the consequences for a poorly run government aren't felt on the local level, for at least years to come.  And you know what, I don't blame these people to still latch on to the Trump, populist idea.  They feel abandoned by the Democratic party.  I'd keep voting for stupid too.  At least they say they care about ME, and not whether or not some mixed up little boys want to pee sitting down in the girls bathroom.  

The Democratic party should take a lesson.  That is still your average voter, and there is plenty of continuity across all classes of people to unify.  The Trump supporters don't watch CNN, Washingont Post, Huffington Post, MSNBC etc.  They know it's not for them, so no amount of accurate reporting of how bad Republicans are at their jobs will ever reach them.  The values have to change to reach these people.  They need to be vying to improve lives for ALL Americans.   I think it would go a long way with voters if the Democratic party took these steps; backed off on the whole gun control thing (save it for another time), realigned their message to focus on things that will benefit ALL people, condemned or severely conditioned their support for special interest groups in that they support ALL americans and not just the <insert minority or disenfranchised>, back off on supporting or express cautious optimism towards extremely progressive ideas, and quite frankly, fall in line with the notion that a strong relationship with China isn't benefitting Americans as much anymore.  All it's giving us is cheap consumer products, that no one is all that thrilled with buying in the first place.  

TLDR; The Democratic message hasn't changed since they got beat in 2016.  The Democrats will lose the presidency again in 2020, if they can't change their message to back off on the major wedge issues and be inclusive to all groups of people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9vck4q/thoughts_on_the_democratic_message/,1,democrats,2018-11-08 21:30:49

 With climate change at our door step (and when we should have made  decisive action about it decades ago), we are now in the timeline where  it’s almost too late, and doing the right thing might not look like we  want it.  
 Doing the right thing will involve playing the hardest of hard ball, and  not letting kindgergarten morals stop us from doing what needs to be  done to save our children and grandchildren. I am a father now, and I  have to be pragmatic for my son’s sake. The pragmatic thing is to attack  hard and fast.  
 A day after the midterm elections, democrats are playing the softest of  softball: already the new democratic leadership is signaling they won’t  impeach, it’s not good politics to upset potential voters.  The  democrats need to stop worrying about the next election, and start  worrying about the lives of all the future people on this planet  
 A day after the midterm elections, republicans are playing the hardest  of hard ball, firing Jeff Sessions so any potential threat from Mueller  can be negated. This is full out naked attack on the possibility of  justice, and we’ll let Donny get away with it again.  No one will truly  fight with the mad King, because they don’t want to be seen “as bad at  the Mad King.” It’s time to take the mad King down, it’s time to fight  with everything we got, it’s time to not hold back.

Any day since he’s been in office, if he was under oath, Donny could  be impeached for the same reason Clinton was unfairly impeached by hard  ball playing, morals-be-damned Newt Gingrich hit squad = lying under  oath.  And the case for impeaching Trump is a million times greater than  Monica’s sucking a peen, Trump’s out to destroy the two things we need  to save the planet – The United Nations and Environmental Protection

1541718836.0,Large number of ballots in Broward County cast no vote in Senate race,25,9vat7m,t5_2qn70,democrats,ILikeBigButtss,0.74,"The vote counts in Broward County are strange. Approximately 25k more people voted in the gubernatorial race than in the Senate race. It was the only county in Florida where there were significantly different numbers of votes cast in the two races. Nearly 5% of the total ballots did not record a vote for senator, compared to a rate of just over 1% for the rest of the state. The other state wide races: Attorney General, Chief Financial Officer, and Commissioner of Agriculture had participation rates in line with the rest of the state: slightly lower than the participation rate in the governors race. Even the CFO race, recieved over 8000 more votes than the Senate race in Broward.This trend was extremely pronounced in the 24th Congressional district, as shown on this [map](https://mobile.twitter.com/mcimaps/status/1060390458143203328)

Does anyone have an explanation for this? The only somewhat plausible explanation I've seen is that the [design of the ballot] (https://cdn.ballotpedia.org/images/7/74/Florida_sample_ballot_%28Broward_County%29.pdf) caused some voters to miss the race. 

It just seems odd to me that so many people would go to the polls and then not vote in the tightly contested statewide race.

As we all recall Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed on June 19,1953 for highly treasonous activities with then Soviet Union when they handed over our national secrets.

Now lot of Trump's supporters will say their president was not in possession of any missile defense technology or any other national secrets that Rosenbergs passed to our worst enemy and paid the ultimate price for their actions.

But Trump did receive our country's citizen's databases  from the Russians on June 9th,2016 in a Trump Tower meeting where the top Russian politicians and oligarchs and personal friends of Putin including a top female Russian lawyer who was in direct touch with her president while she was showing all the hacked emails from Hillary's computers that Trump asked for.

In case some Americans didn't hear about this that right before that meeting took place which was attended by almost every Trump campaign officials including his son Don Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign Manager Paul Manafort, Trump openly asked Russia to help him in his election by extracting 30,000 emails from his opponent Hillary's computers.

Even though for more than 2 years he had been denying that there was no collusion between him, his family members or his campaign team with the Russians but Mr. Mueller knew otherwise.

Now after his son Don Jr. told him about his own testimony to the congressional committees and at the Special Counsel's office. Trump knew that he was in a whole lot of trouble from the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office than what he originally thought of.

That is the main reason why after ridiculing first and then pleading with his AG Jeff Sessions to take over the Russia inquiry in his hands just to scuttle it right away, Trump fired the man who recused himself from the Russia investigation.

And very sheepishly Trump then appointed Matthew Whitaker as the acting AG even though this guy was number 4 or 5 in the line of succession in the Justice Dept. 

The only reason why Mr. Whitaker got the job is because he came on a show on CNN two months back and suggested something like this, ""Russia inquiry should be scuttled by starving Mr. Mueller's investigation so that he has no money to conduct any inquiry.""

No wonder Trump liked the idea so much that he gave him the job of acting AG bypassing so many highly qualified employees in the Justice Dept., including Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein.

1541676166.0,Why Democrats need to champion economic opportunities for geographically diverse areas.,3,9v6gul,t5_2qn70,democrats,gadgetcool5,0.56,"Four days ago, corporate behemoth Amazon was reported to be in advanced talks to locate its second headquarters in [northern Virginia](https://www.axios.com/amazon-advanced-talks-second-headquarters-northern-virginia-b1d9cfbd-0bb1-40ee-9941-5b80c4c9a9f1.html). Meanwhile today, it was reported that [Google is considering adding up to 20,000 workers in New York City](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-could-add-12000-new-workers-in-big-new-york-city-office-expansion-2018-11-07), and Amazon another 25,000.

All of these expansions are in CA, NY, or DC. 

If you ask me, this presents a number of long term challenges, if they do indeed represent trends in corporate America. 

This growth will drive young workers and families into areas with very high costs of living, especially high housing cost, which is by far the biggest source of private household debt in America. That means the high incomes and wages offered by these companies will be offset and neutered by an ever-spiraling increase in housing prices, if what we have seen in San Francisco is any indication. 

This is very bad news for lower income and underprivileged people, disproportionately POC, living in these areas, as it will drive them out of affordable housing and increase their commute as well.

Finally, as far as for Democrats and for our democracy, it will concentrate more and more young people and Democratic voters into a few areas where they will effectively be disenfranchised thanks to the Senate and the Electoral College. 

As these young people leave their homes in Middle America, the smaller cities and towns go into decline, become filled with older people, and this is a recipie for resentment, hate, and Trumpism, not to mention other problems like poverty and drug addiction.

In contrast, we have seen that when advanced industry moves into a previously underdeveloped area, like what happened with North Carolina's Research Triangle, with Northern Virginia itself, and across the sunbelt, it tends to liberalize these areas. Young people come in from more metropolitan areas and these people are Democratic voters. Further, economic growth is more spread out and it is good for these smaller cities as well. This kind of growth tends to be more equitable because the cost of living starts out lower and there is more room to grow land-wise. These workers will be enfranchised politically as well as economically.

Therefore, I believe Democrats should advocate that big tech companies not focus their growth opportunities only on places like New York, D.C., or California, but support ""smaller"" towns and cities such as Phoenix, Denver, St. Louis, Columbus, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, etc. to attract tech investment as well. When growth is spread out geographically it is good for everyone. This will be good for workers, good for the middle class, good for the country, and good for Democrats.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9v6gul/why_democrats_need_to_champion_economic/,2,democrats,2018-11-08 06:22:46
1541676487.0,The Florida Senate Race could be decided by the poor design of the ballot in Broward County,3,9v6i7q,t5_2qn70,democrats,ILikeBigButtss,0.61,"Right now, Bill Nelson trails Rick Scott by 26,000 votes. The gap is likely to narrow as votes continue to be tallied in Broward County. 

Something strange seems to be going on in the results from Broward County. The County has an anomalously high number of ballots cast that left the Senate race blank. The rate of non voting in the Senate race in Broward is more than double that of any other county in Florida. Nearly 5% of the total ballots did not record a vote for senator, compared to a rate of just over 1% for the rest of the state. This was the only county in the state where there the governor's race and senate race had significantly different rates of non voting. The other state wide races: Attorney General, Chief Financial Officer, and Commissioner of Agriculture had participation rates in line with the rest of the state.

The discrepancy may be attributable to the [design of the ballot](https://cdn.ballotpedia.org/images/7/74/Florida_sample_ballot_%28Broward_County%29.pdf). The senate race is located directly under the ballot instructions and some people may have missed the race, assuming that the whole column was instructions and skipped over it. All the other statewide office races are located in the center column and had the expected participation rates.

The 25K fewer votes than expected could well decide the election. Broward County has voted nearly 40% in favor of Nelson and he quite possibly misses out on 10k net votes in his favor beacause of this.

Here are the current vote totals.

I feel like we did great last night, but not as great as we could have, or maybe should have.  I am curious to see what the people who visit this sub think the greates strengths and weaknesses of the 2018 Democratic Party strategy were.

I believe that the progressive wing of the party has the right message on policy, but they have played right into the hands of the Republican narrative of radicalism despite that not necissarily being the case.  Polling shows that most Americans support progressive policies, but yet democrats who tout them consistently fall short as of late. My personal belief is that Democrats need to find a way to distance themselves from the ""mob"" and ""socialist"" label while staying true to what they stand for. At the same time, I believe we should work to find a catchy and concise way to describe the extremism of the alt-right and many modern day republicans, because casting them as authoritarians and facists isn't working despite the party's flirtation with those ideals.

(Also voter suppression, gerry-mandering, foreign interference, etc. but those things are difficult to address purely from a voter standpoint)

I'm already seeing the ""Pelosi is too old, we need new blood like Bernie event though he's the same age"" type nonsense all over social media, like NPR's Facebook page. I get it. Not everyone is going to have Obama's charisma and youth, the reality of politics is that they favor the old.

So, FWIW from a swing voter, the ""Bernie or Bust"" shit has got to go. The GOP has managed to mangle by *extremely* well with a minority voting base by adhering to Reagan's Eleventh Commandment and lockstepping with party lines even as they moved further and further into Right field. 

Rather than complaining that a Democrat-favored candidate has taken PAC/corporate money, or only supported the ACA instead of true single-payer, or made some comment in the 90s about marriage only being between a man or woman, or engaged in multinational trade deals, or foreign policy allows for military intervention, the focus needs to be on breaking the GOP deathgrip on the nation by any legal means necessary. 

If you're on the Left side of the American political spectrum, a Center-Right Democrat is still far better than a Far-Right authoritarian populist, and there's a reason the GOP push the ""both parties are the same and equally corrupt"" line, knowing that they have the Republican vote no matter what.

So, FWIW from someone's voted for all flavors of Democrat, Republican, and Third-Party candidates along the way, **stay unified** in pushing back this corrupt authoritarian bullshit, and don't spend the next two years falling to infighting. A Red resurgence in 2020 would likely be devastating to the next few decades of American politics, and confirm that the last two years are the new normal, rather than the dying gasp of the Confederacy and the Boomer's sociopathic monopoly on power.

Impeachment is a long shot, given the gains Republicans made in the Senate. So what is the Democrats' path to 270 votes in the Electoral College? Donald Trump won 304 electoral college votes, meaning the Democrats need a net gain of 35 votes to defeat him. No one state is enough to make the difference. Where should the Democrats focus their energy to achieve these gains? While Trump is very reluctant to campaign outside the states he won in 2016, he seems to believe maintaining his base will be enough to win reelection. Where do Democrats have the best opportunities to flip enough electoral college votes to defeat Trump?

**Pennsylvania:**These 20 electoral college votes would be over half the electoral votes needed to deny Trump a second term. This is a state Trump won by less than 44,000 votes. The gains the Dems made in flipping congressional.seats in Penn. Are more from redistricting than necessarily anti-Trump sentiment. But i would imagine this state has to be the top priority of the Democrats. 

**Michigan:**This state was won by President Trump by 11,000 votes in 2016. The 16 electoral votes would not be enough to flip the Presidency, but it would be a solid start for the Democrats

**Wisconsin:** This was another close result, with Trump winning by less than 23,000 votes. These 10 electoral votes could be a difference-maker and there is now a Democrat governor to help defeat Trump. 


**Florida:**: The win by Ron Desantis in the race for Governor shows that Florida is still a Republican state. However, 1.4 million felons will (probably) be eligible to vote in 2020 and that really could swing FLA to the Democrats. However, Republicans have been known to attempt to suppress the minority vote, so it is possible that new laws will be enacted to prevent felons from voting. This remains an important state but it's far from a sure thing that Democrats can win Florida. However, the 29 electoral votes would be a difference-maker in the Presidential election.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9v2cdx/the_path_to_270_in_2020/,1,democrats,2018-11-07 22:12:27

1541646320.0,It's time to start talking about changing the Senate.,6,9v29w9,t5_2qn70,democrats,ProserpinasEdge,0.58,"With all the problems that the districting processes of the House and the electoral college can sometimes present democracy, they are at least apportioned in a semi-representative way, and we can address unfairness (gerrymandering) through legal recourse and elections. But the composition of the Senate is the least representative part of our democracy, and the one we most need to change if liberal democracy is going to survive in the long term. Every year, the right wing and its racist, socially-reactionary conservatives move closer and closer to giving up on democracy all together in order to hold on to power, and the Senate is quickly becoming their best chip in the game. Even if the left takes back the presidency in 2020, we would need an almost impossible majority in the Senate to actually legislate over Right wing defiance. The best solution: change the composition of the Senate.

Let's be honest, the fact that both Montana and California get 2 senators is not very representative. The way Senate seats are assigned gives the rural minority an outsized voice in running the country while effectively neutralizing urban voices. But if we gave every state 1 Senate seat, and then gave the 50 largest metro areas 1, the Senate would finally be balanced between rural and urban voices. California would have several senators, while Montana would only have one, as is much more representative given the population disparities.

This kind of change wouldn't happen overnight, but last night's election highlights the need for it. It will require an amendment to the constitution, but while that may be a long journey, we can start that journey now, and even make it a part of our platforms in 2020, 2022, and 2024, until we finally have enough Senate and House seats to make it happen.

Our democracy is increasingly held hostage by a smug, self-centered, xenophobic rural minority, who can cling to power even during a wave election such as last night's because one of our legislative bodies is structurally designed to give an unfair advantage to them.

1541634703.0,[Question] Funding universal healthcare / question about messaging,1,9v0k2j,t5_2qn70,democrats,AllyUnion,0.53,"Something that has been on my mind when the opposition talks about funding for universal healthcare and I have questions about the existing model and future model.

Now, the arguments I hear mostly against such a system is ""government run healthcare"", ""increased taxes"" and ""taking away your employment healthcare""

Let me define some categories:

A = the current cost that all businesses pay for healthcare in the US

B = the current cost that all individuals pay for healthcare in the US through their employers

C = the current costs that all individuals pay for healthcare in the US that are additional (like doctor visits, out of pocket expenses, drug expenses, etc)

D = the current costs that all individuals pay for healthcare in the US NOT through employers

E = the current costs that are covered by government programs (Medicare, etc)

F = the current costs that are generated by uninsured

G = any other costs under the current healthcare system in the US not covered by the previous categories cited

H = A+B+C+D+E+F+G = total healthcare cost in the US in the current system

So here's my question, if we were to move to a universal healthcare model which isn't the same as ""single payer"" -- why isn't the model discussed that taxes on businesses and individuals would be nearly the same level of funding as A+B+C+D?  (Or something along those lines?)

Why isn't the argument that the cost to A and B+C would be significantly reduced in general?

Why isn't it something like, take all the current funding for healthcare being paid in the system, move it into one big system, reduce costs, and shrink the amount paid?",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9v0k2j/question_funding_universal_healthcare_question/,1,democrats,2018-11-07 18:51:43

Florida had Nelson and Gillum up by 5 to 7 points in the latest polls, and it looks like they have both lost. Florida is trending more red in my opinion and Trump seems to run up numbers in the panhandle and rural counties. 

The Georgia Governor's race was corrupt as hell, but Oprah and Obama were sent there to campaign for Abrams, she was up in a few late polls, and it looks like Kemp beat her rather significantly. 

The House looks like 30 or so pickups which isn't terrible but the Senate was a nightmare. This was nowhere near the waves of 2010 or 2014 the GOP had and we're talking about the most unpopular president maybe ever.

Am I just being a Debbie downer or is there serious cause for concern? I just don't feel Repubs should have performed so well.

1541629362.0,"With Democrats controlling the House from Jan 1st,'19, Trump will try to squash the Russia inquiry right now. By firing Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rosenstein, he'll order the new AG to take all the papers from Mr. Mueller and burn them inside the White House.",12,9uztq1,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.67,"In ""A Partisan War Awaits Trump. That Just Might Suit Him"", Peter Baker has given a warning to Trump while writing in his Op-Ed in today's NYT that Trump should be ready for a very rough time in his 2 years of presidency.

To add my own opinion towards Peter's piece, I also like to inform all the Americans that it is quite possible that Trump will act very fast now before the new House members take the oath of office on January 1st,2019. 

Because he knows once the Democrats take charge of the House, they'll ask for all the Russia investigation papers.

And that won't give Trump enough time to hide his tracts about his 2016 campaign's collusion with Russia.

It's my bet that Trump will either fire Jeff Sessions now, most probably within a day or two or tell his Current AG to take an early retirement with mutually agreed terms. 

We can bet that Mr. Sessions will be highly rewarded for his generosity by Trump, maybe with the U.S. Ambassador's role in Russia.

Mr. Sessions might like that idea because then he can meet his old friend Mr. Kislyak whom he met three times while campaigning for Trump .

We must recall that Mr. Sessions had no problem in lying to both the chambers of congress at his confirmation hearings saying this, "" I never met the Russian Ambassador in my life.""

So my fellow Americans stay tuned to the fact that Trump is going to move very fast now to get rid of his AG, his Deputy AG and also Mr. Mueller, the Special Counsel appointed by Rod Rosenstein. 

We can bet our money that Trump will force his newly appointed AG whoever it is, to snatch all the papers from Mr. Mueller and burn them in the fireplace of the Lincoln bedroom in the White House.

That's why I hope another ""Deepthroat"" will come out of the cold and divulge shocking revelations about Trump's collusion with Russia to a journalist from a major newspaper like New York Times or Washington Post or to a television network like C.N.N. or M.S.N.B.C.

Although Ex-Deputy Director of F.B.I. William Mark Felt Sr. died a few years back but maybe a true patriot like him or maybe another true American like John Dean will show up before the new Dem led congress and reveal everything like Nixon's White House counsel did in 1973-'74's congressional hearings.

If we all recall that it was Mr. Dean who told the Dem led congress then that Nixon was hiding lot of recorded tapes in the basement of the White House.

He also told everyone present in that Judicial Committee hearings' room that hundreds of those tapes contained Nixon's own instructions to his deputies recorded in his own voice about how to burglarize his opponent Senator George McGovern's headquarters in the Watergate hotel in Washington DC before their presidential election contest of 1972. 

Mr. Dean also told the Senate Watergate investigative committee about Nixon's very specific role in the Watergate scandal while testifying and saying before the same committee in 1973 ""I believe this scandal will down my boss's presidency. ""

And lo and behold, it did. Nixon resigned on August 9th, 1974.

Now we want another Mr. Dean or Mr. Felt to tell us where exactly is the tape that Mr. Comey alluded to when he hinted in his one and only book writing ""Lordi, there will be a tape.""

If we recall that the tape that the ex- F.B.I. Director was referring to in his book was the same he and other higher officials in the F.B.I. Headquarters in Washington listened to before Mr. Comey was unceremoniously fired by Trump.

If any Americans doesn't know it yet, it was the same tape which contained a conversation between Trump's National Security Director Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador to U.S. Mr. Kislyak that the F.B.I. agents recorded on December 27, 2016.

All the Redditors should know that this particular conversation was recorded through a bug placed in the Russian Embassy in Washington, not in the Trump Tower that Trump accused Obama for without any proof.

It is highly likely that the above tape also has Trump's very clear voice in the background instructing Mr. Flynn to tell his Russian counterpart that he'd lift all the sanctions once His Highness Donald J. Trump ascended to the throne on January 20th, 2017.

Every American citizens like us and also the residents of this country should know the fact that Russia for some unknown reasons didn't put any retaliatory sanctions on U.S. that they always do after we put any sanctions, big or small, on them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9uztq1/with_democrats_controlling_the_house_from_jan/,3,democrats,2018-11-07 17:22:42

The traitor GOP committed every crime in the book to stop Americans from voting, to deceive and intimidate us at the polls, and to defraud the result after the fact - which is no doubt continuing in close races that have not yet been called.  

Our efforts were just enough in the House - a spark of light, blinding for the darkness that surrounds it.  **America has retaken the House of Representatives**, which in January will mean the name of that body will be less of the Orwellian obscenity it has been under gerrymandered Traitor control.

But even that flip provides only the narrowest of opportunities - not because of close margins, but because what we do with that toehold rests entirely on the shoulders of a few Representatives in the leadership.  As generals in a war, they are a mixed bag - to say the least.  I won't sour this moment of hope by diving into criticism of individuals, but we must keep our heads about the fact that there is nothing inevitable about what those few choose to do with control of the House.

Impeachment inquiries into Donald Trump and his menagerie of arrogant traitors are far from assured, despite **every single day** since 1/20/17 having involved public displays of felony.  Investigations are likely on a more mundane level, but leaders with the wrong mentality will foolishly aim them merely to *embarrass* Republicans - something their own behavior already does beyond limit, proving the enemy incapable of shame.  

They will be tempted to focus on 2020, even though memory is short, rather than defending the country **right now**.  They will be tempted to cite Traitor control of the Senate as an excuse to pretend that the impeachment process would be ""pointless"", and squander the opportunity for crystal-clear moral and legal confrontation against a mad tyrant in favor of a muddled stew of occasional, symbolic PR victories.

And by ""tempted,"" I mean this is probably going to be the approach.  Boldness from below retook the House for America, not the collegial politics of long-term leaders who accused the very energy that returned the House to them of being ""uncivil.""  So be aware of both this moment's opportunity and its fragility.  

Even most regular voters do not understand these details, and shouldn't be expected to.  They - quite reasonably - expect that Democratic control of the House will amount to something more than *speed bumps* to the lawless wehrmacht rampaging over American institutions.  Many are expecting impeachment inquiries, regardless of what the Senate might do, and the fury and disillusionment if they do not occur will be severe.

In the war to restore American democracy, D-Day has not yet come.  The memory of America's Dunkirk two years ago still burns in memory,  unaddressed.  But we have landed on the beaches of Sicily, though led by some whose advice would have made that impossible.

My views mostly align with the Democratic Party, however, there are some issues that I am completely against. I would like to know why the party candidates/leader support them and also where do you guys stand on them. 

I feel like the Democratic Party can win over so many hearts if they just change their views on some issues that aren’t good for the country imo. 

Issue 1: Immigration. I don’t agree with giving anyone that comes to country illegally citizenships. Neither do I believe that “caravans” should be allowed. It sets a dangerous precedent and it’ll only encourage more caravans and people to take more risk to cross the borders. 

Issue 2: Aid programs. This has got to be controlled. I see so many people who work to earn in cash and also get EBT, social security, etc from govt to feed their family. I earn six figures and they live a better lifestyle than I do. 

Issue 3: Taxes. This goes handinhand with govt programs. There won’t be any need to raise taxes if the programs are not overburdened. 

I am a naturalized citizen who came from a 3rd world country. Most people there there will jump on an opportunity to come here legally/illegally.

1541554845.0,Does anyone else think The Daily NYT podcast is trash?,0,9uqgvv,t5_2qn70,democrats,kHartos,0.47,"I’ve been thinking this for a while and this morning’s podcast ‘A Field Guide to Today’s Elections’ was the nail in the coffin for me. For me, the thing is that, while I don’t expect or want the podcast to carry the water for liberal viewpoints, I actually think it is intentionally subversive to its mainly liberal audience. It comes off as enlightened and thought-provoking, but when you unpack it, what it really does well is encourage bullshit liberal handwringing over pet conservative causes and viewpoints. It reinforces conventional wisdom of Republican power in a defeatist liberal mindset. 


I know this sounds conspiratorial, and maybe it isn’t intentional, but I’m certain the effect is real. 


For instance, this morning’s podcast was a conversation between the host Michael Barbaro and NYT reporter Alexander Burns. Barbaro asks Burns to analyze four critical themes analyzing this election. So right away we are diving in subjective opinion here, but they both do well to speak authoritatively here without a hint of ‘this is one person’s opinion.’  


**Theme 1: Immigration.** Doesn’t mention this as the Trump/GOP wedge issue of choice. Or the outright racism and outrageous lies of the caravan. Instead, they discuss it through the lens of one congressional district on the border where ‘this isn’t an abstract issue’. Frames the issue as Democrats needing to bend to conservative voters wishes to have a chance to win. If they don’t, Dems are fucked, basically. 

**Theme 2: Kavanaugh.** U serious? How many people are really thinking of Kavanaugh at the polls today? I mean some, sure, but this is the #2 theme for you? We are batting 2/2 in analyzing the GOP causes du jour. Burns states the Kavanaugh vote screwed over Heitkamp. Can’t be a centrist in a conservative state. Um, she did get elected didn’t she? Burns says that Heitkamp was the last Dem to announce her vote on Kavanaugh. Nope, that was Manchin. Sloppy.  

**Theme 3: Guns.** If Mike Coffman doesn’t get re-elected it’s about guns. Not a check on Trump. Not health care. Just guns. Cites no real evidence. Just obvious conventional wisdom. 

**Theme 4: Health care.** Finally, I guess. It’s only the top issue in polls. Not given as much time as the first two issues, immigration and Kavanaugh. Burns states that Dems wouldn’t have a chance in states like Missouri if we didn’t have this issue going for us. 


So to sum up, Barbaro and Burns make up viewpoints on conservative wedge issues and completely ignore what polling says about this midterm being a referendum on Trump, health care, and the economy/trade wars. The pattern of following the lead on issues being pushed by conservatives and speaking of them in pained and defeatist tones is something that happens over and over again on the podcast. I am now pretty much only hate-listening to it, and it bugs me how much critical acclaim it gets.   


I know this is weird to be posting on election day. Can't help myself.

I voted this year via an absentee mail-in ballot (FWAB). My vote was rejected because of the USPS. I mailed my vote on October 11th. It was just returned to me today on voting day. My voting packet arrived in the US and was given a “Return to Sender” sticker for having a bad address. The address is what I was told to use in the forms to send my ballot to the Campbell County Virginia Registrar. The address IS CORRECT. It arrived back here in Georgia on November 2nd and was returned to me today November 6th. The envelope had a tear strip that likely was fiddled with, but from what I can tell they were not successful in taking the vote out of the envelope if that were the case

My mind is BLOWN that I was not able to have my voice heard as an American Citizen. It is apparent that people in the USPS do not want people who live overseas to vote. I serve as a US Ambassador for the Peace Corps in my community in Georgia and shared about the great deed I did today as an American Citizen. Now it turns out I did nothing. Not even my voice could be heard.

As I have learned from a head person at my county's Board of Elections, this has been a problem this voting season.

People need to know this is a problem.

What can be done?!

Trump.

In one way, Trump has managed to do one thing in America that even Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler couldn't do to their countries : Destroy the very fabric that binds a country together.

He unleashed total anarchy and a reign of terror against the immigrants, against the established Democrats just to win his elections that no other Republican president could ever think of.

No wonder Michael M. Grynbaum and Niraj Chokshi pointed out this latest controversy regarding Trump's latest racist ad by saying ""Even Fox News Stops running Trump Caravan Ad Criticized as Racist"" .

While applauding their Op-Ed in today's NYT, I've to state that Trump's surprise turnaround in an interview given in the last minute of this most important midterm elections in the history of this country saying he'll change after today's elections is not going to fool us.

He has already given us a glimpse of what we always suspected : Trump is a racist bastard of the first order .

Even George W. Bush went to a Mosque after 9/11 trying to quell the fear and anxiety that Americans were having against the Muslims by saying , ""Islam is not our enemy !""

But Trump, son of another racist bastard and a ruthless member of KKK, has no qualms to propagate an atmosphere of fear and anxiety to win this midterms for his acolytes in the Republican/Trump party.

So this latest 30 second ad, that he himself celebrated by tweeting a longer version of it in his tweeter feeds, has established Trump as the leader of a wild wolf pack, not a president.

His talk now promising to tone down his rhetoric after the midterms should not be taken as an olive branch by any members of our parties on the left.

We should presume that just like a leopard in the jungle doesn't change it's stripes, Trump cannot change his deadly attitudes.

Thus he'll will never behave like a human being.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9uohmp/trumps_last_minute_promise_to_tone_down_his/,0,democrats,2018-11-06 16:55:44

Just had to rant.",20,9um8s8,t5_2qn70,democrats,these_three_things,0.66,"As a Christian conservative, I can't stand Republicans. I didn't vote Trump, but I maybe held out hope for fiscal conservatism. I hold many views that liberals would disagree with, and that they might even hate me for; but those are personal. They are mine, reserved for myself. On a governmental level, I am voting this election to support liberal values and Democratic candidates—because they are the only party with any values. 

Republicans (aside from their staggering hypocrisy) love to mandate ""Christian values,"" but in the entirety of the Bible, there is NO place where God commanded Christians to enforce their values upon the world. The law of YHWH is for Christians to obey, and to hold one another accountable to. That's it. As someone who loves Jesus, I am sick of the repugnant circus of people claiming to spread God's love through governmental oppression and disenfranchisement—while simultaneously adopting racist, corrupt, abusive, and self-righteous stances toward the needy, the marginalized, the under-represented, the scientific, the conscientious, and the idealistic citizens of this nation.

**Abortion:** Personally, I believe it is wrong. But I would vote to legalize it. If Republicans truly wanted to fight abortion, they would stop ridiculous abstinence campaigns and efforts to curb sex education, and instead fund extensive public sex education and promote access to birth control and other resources—which has been proven time and time again to reduce rates of STDs, pregnancy, and abortions. If you actually care about people, and not just abortions, then hopefully you can empower them to understand the choices they are making, instead of keeping them in the dark and punishing them when they make mistakes.

**Marijuana:** I don't believe in recreational smoking. But a criminal offense? You've gotta be kidding. Legalize it. Study it. Sell it and tax it. From an economic standpoint, the war on weed is a colossal failure, and legal weed is a huge benefit. And in a country where alcohol consumption is legal and celebrated, there is no integrity in jailing people who smoke reefer. 

**Climate Change:** Since when is science a partisan issue? Oh yeah, since Republicans started defending oil and gas and coal. COAL. Are you serious. When 98% of the GLOBAL (not just partisan) scientific community agrees that we are messing up the world and better change our tune quick, no one with a shred of respect for intellectual pursuit can say, ""Nah, the Democrats are funding it all."" Start funding sustainable energy sources and disincentivize the fossil fuel status quo. I mean, it's just the entire earth at stake here.

**Fracking:** Oh yeah, I totally support dumping toxic sludge into our groundwater supplies. Can't see why anyone would care whether entire towns or regions can drink clean water or be earthquake-free.  

**LGBT Rights:** I don't believe the Bible endorses LGBT issues. I don't really either, if we are talking about within the Church. But I vote pro-LGBT all the way. If we care about connecting with and and protecting a segment of people who are marginalized and victimized, trying to regulate their behavior, or their choices, only leads to division and strife. I have gay friends whom I support and value, and they know how I feel... but if my love and friendship doesn't convince them of my view of Jesus, then I'm not gonna impose what I believe upon them either. I hate that the issue has become so combative and charged.

**Net Neutrality:** Cannot believe this is an actual issue. Republicans crying ""government regulation"" and trying to defend the ""free market""... There IS no free market in the telecom industry. They've managed to write their own protections into state legislatures, and to instill arguably the most laughable shill in history to the FCC who regulates them.

**The Wall:** Of course immigrants are the problem. Couldn't possibly be the crappiest economy in decades, the rampant cronyism at the highest levels of government and corporate power, or the stoking of ignorant fears. It's actually brown people. And the best way to keep them out is to set up concentration camps for their babies at the border. I'm not kidding... this is gonna solve everything.

**PROTECTING TRUMP:** This is the WORST. I cannot believe that this fraud is president. But even if all liberals really were just ""snowflakes"" and Trump were pretty solid... WHY ARE YOU STONEWALLING TAX RETURNS. WHY ARE YOU IMPEDING MUELLER. I don't care what your stripe is, I would hope that anyone reading this loves America enough to want to ensure that ANYONE who holds the office of President is totally fit, able to lead, and above reproach (or at least above obvious corruption).

And ""evangelicals for Trump""... I just can't believe it. How they came to believe that this entitled rich boy represents the working man, that this habitual liar is taking a stand against dishonest politics, that this self-dealing kleptocrat is gonna drain the swamp, that this immature bully is defending America's honor, that the sexual abuser and thrice-married cheater cares about Christian values, is so beyond me. THIS IS NOT YOUR HERO.

r/democrats, you are free to hate my opinions. I'm sure at least a few of you here be repulsed by my morality, and that is fine. I love that we have a country where you can have your beliefs, and I can have mine, and we can actually talk about them if a bunch of ignorant loons don't devolve every issue into opposing slogans, hashtags, and angry cardboard signs.

All that to say, **I voted Democratic because I believe in America.** I believe she stands for more than what we can get out of her pockets while we whip up a fake fervor in the media. As a Christian, I choose integrity—which, ironically, sometimes looks like separating what's good for a church from what's good for a country. Bring on the flak, bring on the love... all I can say on the eve of this election is that I love you all as Americans. 

Even you, Republicans, I love you too—I just don't want you anywhere near the driver's seat.

1541532269.0,Ban abortion to swing the election (but not really),0,9unish,t5_2qn70,democrats,yankeerich,0.48,"This is an emergency and desperate times call for desperate measures. If you allow Republicans to sit and make bold-faced lies all day long while you take the moral High Ground and refuse to do the same, that is a problem. I remember in school they taught us that the British soldiers during the Revolutionary War believed that war had sort of gentlemen's rules. They were ordered to stand in formation and fire together for example. They also wore red coats so you could easily see them. The colonists according to what we were told didn't abide by these ""war rules."" They decided to wear camouflage, to hide and snipe, to not follow these gentlemen's war rules. We were told this is one of the reasons the colonists won the war. The British had their orders to follow these rules so they were sitting ducks. In the current ""war"" Republicans are the colonists side and Democrats are the British army. 

Democrats can win by holding their noses and informing Republican constituencies and everyone else that they now support a ban on abortion. You could switch this around or add to it for example by reversing gay marriage. There will be a certain possibly small number of Republican constituents who will defect to the Democratic Party. And a small advantage he is really all the Democrats need.

So what do you do after you ban abortion? You do the same thing that the state of California is doing right now with the feds. You ignore the Federal ban on abortion and Legalize It in the state of California, and do the same with all other blue states. This is preferably right after you support the federal abortion ban. Yes this is a lie, but the rules have really changed. If one side is getting slaughtered because the other side is willing to demoralize itself and use dirty tricks and outright lies to gain an advantage, then unfortunately the other side has to either follow suit or allow the opposition to take over because the opposition decides to break the rules of ""war' by wearing camouflage while Democrats continue to abide by these moral high ground rules and figuratively ""stand in formation wearing bright red coats.""

After Congress has been swung, Democrats can feel free to reverse the ban on abortion which really was never seriously there in the first place.

You might ask what are the people in red states to do? There are some ways to mitigate this worry. For example, blue States could enter into a compact as humanitarian help to create a fund that would provide transportation to a blue state for the purpose of having an abortion. That is only one idea. I'm sure there are other ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9unish/ban_abortion_to_swing_the_election_but_not_really/,5,democrats,2018-11-06 14:24:29

1. The Democrats are fighting to protect our health care and people with pre-existing conditions. Republicans have already caused premiums to go up, back a lawsuit to strip pre-existing conditions, and have voted 70 times to repeal The ACA without any actual plan to replace it. 
2. The Republicans passed an unpopular $1 trillion tax cut for the richest Americans (read their donors) exploded the deficit. You maybe got about $10 extra which eaten up by the GOP’s increases to health insurance premiums and more expensive products from an unnecessary trade war. Oh and your $10 will expire in 5 years. 
3. Democrats will fight the corruption of the current administration - who uses private jets on our dime, buys expensive tables, and to much more for one comment. Anti-corruption laws have to put in writing the things we didn’t do for ethical reasons because the current Republicans have no ethics. Democrats will investigate why to Trump administration didn’t do more for Puerto Rico, why they haven’t returned the migrant kids that they stripped from their families to put in cages, and how much money is the President profiting off of his position. 
4. The Republicans want to be afraid. Be very afraid. That’s all they have. They want you to be scared of poor Latino women and children that have been walking for 6 months to flee instability and violence (asylum is a legal process). They want you to hate. To hate immigrants, Muslims and gays. The President’s words have already incited anger, hate, and violence. Republicans could run a campaign on accomplishments but instead they resort to the same old hate and fear. Black candidates are thieves, monkeys and rappers (all said by The GOP this year). Women’s activist groups are just little girls (also said). Even if I agreed with basic conservative principles, I would never want to be a part of the team that wants us to hate each other. 

You might wonder why I posted so much during this election when I wrote nothing during 2016. And it’s because I wrote nothing during 2016. For one, I was preparing to graduate school and apply for jobs, so I took the safe approach. Secondly, I had more faith in the American public than I guess it deserved. But for any change, there must first be a traumatic fall. Now we see a massive surge of women candidates, minority candidates and teachers running for office.  There may be hope left in America. Even if 2018 weren’t to go as planned, there is a new wave of people passionate about politics and making an impact on our government. Don’t forget to vote!

1541460357.0,Mormon church conspiring to keep Democrat voters stay at home and not vote,46,9uefay,t5_2qn70,democrats,StreetChampionship,0.71,"I work part-time for a low income housing organization in Utah. People who live in our units are poor, low income, uneducated and lacking resources - they always vote for Democrats. 

My boss  - who likes me because I served an LDS mission and voted Republican - has organized home inspections on election day. She said we shouldn't tell tenants the time of the home inspection nor specify the reasons in great detail for the home inspection. Her letter to tenants - 3 such letters - were designed to make tenants nervous and ensure that they stay at home. 

When I reminded her it was Election day, she said her husband had told her that the orders had come from the highest levels. Her husband is a senior executive at HUD. When I asked if it was the Governor's office or something, she said her husband had told her it was from high up in her LDS Church. Apparently many low income housing units all over Utah are doing home inspections on Election day. This is wrong because they are strategically designed to make Democrats stay at home and not vote.

Given that the low-income housing units are doing this because the LDS church asked them, I guess other organizations are doing the same thing. That is not right. 

When I get a new job - which may take 2 or 3 months - I will upload the letters we sent out to tenants. But that will mean a wait of 2 or 3 months. I will retain this throwaway account until I upload the three letters we sent out to tenants.

Edit - because this is a throwaway account without karma, the system does not show up the comments I wrote. I don't know who to report them to. I also don't know how to prove the connection from the church to people like me who drop off the letters to the tenants. All I can document is the letters we gave tenants. The church is very careful not to implicate itself in such matters, so witnesses like me will always have zero credibility in any court. Then again while I no longer have any illusions about the church, I will never go to court myself because it will devastate members of my family who are still active members - one even serving a mission right now. I will definitely upload the letters our low housing income unit sent tenants to keep them from voting.

Edit 2 - the /r/saltlakecity subreddit deleted my post.

Edit 3 - I am not sure I want to pursue this path of reporting them **BEFORE** the elections because I want Republicans to win, although what the LDS church is doing is wrong and un-American. I support Trump and want the Republicans to win so we can erect a border wall. Illegals should get in line and enter the country legally. If anyone can just roll over the border, we are not a country - we are a joke. There are tens of millions of people who do it legally - takes many 5 years to get an employment green card after 4+2 years of college and then 5 more years to get citizenship. It is wrong for illegals to come in this way and get benefits and a life in America overnight. Get in line!!

Trump and the Republicans have dragged this country so far right that it is a matter of time before we start falling from all the cliffs in this country.

That is why Charles Blow pleaded with all of us to ""Vote, Vote, Vote ! '' in his Op-Ed in NYT today while also asking all of us a question ''You have to ask yourself : Do you want a Congress full of Trump puppets ?"" to which I say NO ! 

Hope you say the same ""NO"" with a promise to vote tomorrow for all the Democrats all over the country if we want to take back our country from a total egomaniac and a prodigy of Devil who just wants to destroy every great values that this great country was built on.

We should really consider this election as our nation's existential moment.

Because if we Democrats fail to take over the Congress from Trump's the Devil's stooges tomorrow then we should prepare for our doomsday as the threat to our existence could not be more imminent than it was ever before.

Trump is squashing now all the good regulations that Obama passed in his 8 great years of presidency so that we could breath better.

Yes, Trump and the Republicans are now dismantling all the good things in America through their stooges running the E.P.A.

It's true that what Trump and the Republicans did in two years is equivalent to writing our death certificates with the cause given ""Asphyxiation"" because under a future Trump and Republican administration, we'll not be able to breath at all.

And since these evil republicans are going to take away our medical care that we're enjoying under Obamacare, we'll die without getting any end of life care under a Trump and Republican administration.

Actually this is not a scare tactic that I'm spreading right before the election.

If we listen to this truthful statement, ""The Republican party is Trump party now. The Republicans are taking a nap somewhere"" as John Bohner, their last Speaker of the house said this year then everyone will know that I'm telling the truth that we all will die if we allow Trump Party to rule America anymore.

Yes, we should call G.O.P. as Trump Party openly because leaders of their party have lost their spine as well as slivers of their dignities that only the ""Maverick"" had shown throughout his stint as a Republican Senator until he gave up trying to save his life from cancer as well as saving his party from heading towards the Armageddon under the tutelage of a president who made a pact with a Russian Devil called Putin to put him in the White House.

If Trump had known how much he had hurt John McCain by saying ""I don't care for people who're captured"", maybe he could attend his funeral after apologizing to Sen. McCain personally and to all of us standing in front of the tv cameras in the White House.

But Trump being Trump didn't think there was any need to say sorry to Mr. McCain or to his family or to anyone in America for his skipping the deployment to Vietnam citing a phantom bone spur.

He's still not sorry that he knowingly cheated in his medical exam while millions of Americans without rich daddies like him were forced to go to Vietnam in the 60's and '70's.

All Trump said was ""Gonorrhea is my personal Vietnam"" ignoring the fact that thousands of Americans came back in body bags and 50,000+ American citizens are still M.I.A. long after the infamous war of Vietnam ended in 1975.

That is the main reason why we've to curb Trump's power next year by making his Republican party taking a dump in each and every elections they're fighting in this year's midterms which will end hopefully without a hitch tomorrow night at around 10 p.m. eastern time all over the country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9udi4l/if_our_citizens_dont_want_another_two_years_of/,3,democrats,2018-11-05 16:30:54

1541367122.0,"Just to please Trump,one of his violent supporters killed 2 women and himself in a Yoga class.This White Nationalist supporter of Trump wanted to take the Florida Governor's race away from Andrew Gillum whom Trump called a ""Thief"" without any proof and DeSantis called a ""Monkey"".",90,9u3c88,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.83,"Although this latest killings happened on Friday, Nov. 2nd which was still 4 days away from the midterms but we've to link this mini massacre at a Yoga class as one more of Trump's rhetoric related crimes besides the three deadly incidents in the last 2 weeks.

We still remember that in all 13 totally innocent elderly Americans died at the hands of Trump's crazies and 12+ pipe bombs sent to Trump's opponents by another White Nationalists / White Supremacists gang member.

With this latest killing in Florida by one of Trump's White Nationalist gunmen, we've to hold Trump criminally responsible even though he didn't tell any of his crazies to start killing innocent Americans right before the midterms to stop the Democrats taking control of the congress.  

But since this deceased gunman had chosen a spot in Tallahassee, Florida where Trump's nemesis Andrew Gillum is a Mayor, it clearly shows that Trump's White Nationalist supporter wanted to change the Florida Governor's race by unleashing 20+ bullets from his handgun.

Janet Reitman was very blunt in her assessment of total failure of our law enforcement agencies to tackle Trump's White Nationalists  when she wrote this in her Op-Ed in today's NYT called ,""U.S. Law Enforcement Failed to See the Threat of White Nationalism. Now They Don't Know How to Stop It.""

Janet was more blunt in her next sentence when she wrote that ""For two decades, domestic counterterrorism strategy has ignored the rising danger of far-right extremism. In the atmosphere of willful indifference, a virulent movement has grown and metastasized.""

Reading Ms. Reitman's account it seems to me that it was indeed another of Trump's White Nationalist crazies that struck at the ""Hot Yoga Tallahassee"" a Yoga studio in Tallahassee, Florida.

I've no doubts in my mind that this was one of Trump's violent supporters who went to the Tallahassee Yoga studio and shot 8 people, killing two beside himself.

Now I strongly believe that Trump had a hand in all these killings in the last two weeks even though he didn't tell the gunmen before or this gunman in Florida to choose a spot in Tallahassee in Florida where his nemesis Andrew Gillum is a Mayor. 

But it clearly shows that Trump's White Nationalist supporter wanted to change the Florida Governor's race by his own killing instincts.

He wanted Trump supported candidate DeSantis to win the race against a Black candidate whom the G.O.P. candidate for Governor called a ""Monkey"".

Maybe our country's most racist and misogynist president Trump inspired this gunman from top to bottom with his vile and hateful messages that he spews everyday in his campaigns for the Republican candidates.

We can bet our money that this gunman in Florida, like all other Trump inspired gunmen in the country, thought the Florida Governor's race was going  towards the First Black Governor of the state after Obama's very inspiring speech to all the Floridians the night before at Andrew Gillum and Bob Nelson's joint campaign rally in Miami, Florida.

So this gunman wanted to turn the race away from the Black candidate all by himself after our thoroughly racist president Trump called the current Mayor of Tallahassee, a ""Thief"" without any evidence.

Scott Beierle, the gunman in the Yoga studio knew that Andrew Gillum was doing a fantastic job as the first Black Mayor being a resident of the town himself.

This gunman knew that his Black Mayor lowered the crime rates in the city to the lowest level ever.

But this White Nationalist and a thoroughly racist and a misogynist  resident of Tallahassee, like his favorite president Trump is, started a rain of fire inside the Yoga studio so that the people of the town where he lived and the state of Florida will be too scared to go out from their homes after this mini massacre and vote for DeSantis through absentee ballots thinking Andrew Gillum will be too weak on crimes as a Florida governor.

Although it's up to our F.B.I. and other law enforcement officers to find out what happened in the Yoga studio in Florida but if they pour over all of Trump's tweets they'll find a common thread between Trump and his White Nationalists crazies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9u3c88/just_to_please_trumpone_of_his_violent_supporters/,8,democrats,2018-11-04 16:32:02

We knew it for a long time.

Peter Baker in his Op-ed in today's NYT titled ,"" Once Reluctant to Speak Out, an Energized Obama Now Calls Out His Successor"" has given very lively account of our last but first Black American president's hitting the campaign trails again to make the Democrats take over the congress.

To Peter's very nice and hearty comments in his latest piece, I've to say that it is quite fitting that Obama, whom Trump harassed for seven years only because our last president was black, is now on the campaign trail running toe to toe with the worst human being on earth who took over the presidency of America with ""total"" help from Russia.

But if we look back at Trump's adult life starting at age 21, we can only conclude that our current illegitimate president was a thoroughly racist human being starting at a very young age.

Being born to a thoroughly racist bastard father called Fred Trump didn't help Trump to learn the virtues of humanity that we all learned from our "" We should love all the races"" parents.

But what Trump learnt from his KKK member father and the genes from his bootlegging and brothel running grandfather called Frederick Trump was ""Hate. Hate. And more hate for the Blacks and other minority citizens of this country and the world.""

No wonder Trump used a dog whistle yesterday to tell his equally moronic campaign attendees that someone with a name of Obama with an ""H"" as his middle name was campaigning for the Democrats.

Not being fools like his crazies at his rallies , we all knew what this devil's advocate was trying to convey to his dog catchers : ""That Barack Obama is still a Muslim with a middle name of Hussein. And thus he should never had been appointed to the highest executive post of the country, the President of the United States.""

We also have to remember that Trump made this pronouncement  to his Muslim hating xenophobic supporters so that they reject any one with a Muslim middle or last name.

But this thoroughly unscrupulous and totally racist human being had no problem in pocketing almost $11 billion from a Muslim country out of a 110 billion dollars worth of arms deal that he signed with the Saudis last year.

Probably getting a 10% kickback as a major part of his bribes, Trump is telling all the Muslims of the world, ""If you pay me a big chunk of money worth billions of dollars, I don't mind how many times you sneak into our country or go out without my customs and immigration agents bothering you at the airport checkouts.'

I'll bet my money that Trump told the Muslims in Saudi Arabia with whom he danced with the swords last year, ""If you want to you can also hide in those caravans coming to our border at the end of next year. I'll order 15,000 of my combat troops to shoot only at the children and mothers in the caravan and spare all you Saudi citizens' lives."" 

So before we go to the polls today until Tuesday, we the citizens of this great country have to remember that Trump is being extremely cozy with the Royals of a country who just killed and dismembered the body of a journalist beside killing 4,000+civilians and caused the deaths of 8,000+brave men and women of our armed forces in 2 subsequent unnecessary wars after the worst ""American Carnage"" on our soil that happened on 9/11.

And what we saw last week with the arrests of 3 of his White Nationalists supporters, it's quite possible that Trump's very divisive and filthy languages that is coming out everyday from his dirty and ugly mouth before the midterms might cause the deaths of more innocent Americans before Nov. 6th like we saw last night in Tallahassee, Florida where another of Trump's crazies went and shot 2 women to death and critically injured 6 others in a yoga class called Hot Yoga Tallahassee.

Now that's why I'll suggest to our law enforcement agencies that they should hold Trump criminally responsible for the murders of two elderly Black folks in Louisville, KY and the slaughter of 11 elderly Jews in Pittsburgh,PA.

We all know that he'd not shown any compassion towards those American citizens who just died at the hands of his crazies. He only tweeted about baseball games right after he attended the funeral of 11 Jews in PA and not about any dead Americans who died because of the total hatred that he's spewing in all his campaigns.

Yes, Trump is campaigning as if nothing has happened in our American cities a week back. For him it's business as usual.

1541217679.0,Looking for real Deficit Hawks (Clinton-Gingrich) in the modern Democratic Party,0,9tnjoi,t5_2qn70,democrats,WheresSmokey,0.5,"TLDR below

&#x200B;

So I grew up a hard core Republican, spent the last few years as Libertarian, and then, as my knowledge of politics deepened and my understanding of the two parties (and their history) grew I realized that I was not a neo-con or a ""Trumpian"" and seeing as those two groups have essentially taken over the GOP, I recognized that I could not, in good conscience, vote GOP. 

&#x200B;

I now see myself as more of a Bill Clinton Democrat. My issue here is that as much as the modern Democratic party harps on the GOP for failing to fix this deficit problem (and even going so far as to make it worse, which I absolutely fault them for, especially with the 2017 Tax Cuts), I don't see a lot of modern, strong democrats making an effort in this direction.

&#x200B;

Again, I'm fairly new to supporting the Democratic Party so my research on Democrat figures is lacking here. But with Healthcare and immigration being in the limelight this election year, finding information on federal congressmen about their stance on the deficit is difficult. 

&#x200B;

Overall here, I'm looking forward to 2020 and seeking someone to look to who actually cares about convention and being fiscally responsible with taxpayer money (not cutting taxes when we have insane amounts of deficits, making government more efficient, cutting THE RIGHT programs and not ones that benefit the American people, not overturning traditional protocol such as the nuclear option in the Senate, and can actually carry their office with an air of dignity and honor) obviously ideas the GOP has decided to abandon.

&#x200B;

TL;DR  
I'm looking for a National level Democrat who adheres to the ideals the GOP used to champion: Deficit Hawking, Dignity, Convention, and helping small business not big business. I'm really hoping there is room in the ""big tent"" for these ideals and was wondering if the users on this sub would be able & willing to help me find a good dem to look to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9tnjoi/looking_for_real_deficit_hawks_clintongingrich_in/,10,democrats,2018-11-03 00:01:19

1541202619.0,On Immigration,1,9tla9v,t5_2qn70,democrats,deaconheel,0.51,"Immigration - As with nearly every subject, the Republican Party is dreadfully wrong on immigration.  It seems to me their entire is FEAR - be afraid of immigrants, be afraid of Hispanics, be afraid of Muslims, be afraid of children, no matter what, be afraid, be very afraid. But the only thing to fear is exactly how many Americans subcribe to this fear mongering and racism.

And yes, the party’s attitude on immigration is completely and totally racist. Why? Because the only immigration that the ever care about involves people with darker colored skin.  In fact, the second part to Trump referring to “shithole countries” was a remark about why don’t we get more people from Norway.  “Shithole countries” as a term to describe human beings who want to make a better life for themselves, people who go through an extensive vetting process and on average turn out more successful.

It’s also not about illegal immigration at all, because the Stephen Millers of the administration also want to restrict legal immigration. That’s what the “shithole” discussion was about. They simply don’t want more browns in this country.  Even to the point of arguing against reuniting families.  Supposedly the party of “family values” want to end what they call chain migration, but what is really called family reunification.  Because what we know is that people who immigrate with family members around do better. They integrate better, they succeed more, which is why this process exists.

Speaking of families, let’s not for get that the Trump administration has been systematically orphaning the children of people trying to come here.  Let’s make that more clear - TAKING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND PUTTING KIDS IN CAGES.  That whole process hasn’t been resolved.  We took the kids, deported their parents, kept the kids, and then claimed we couldn’t find the parents.  I do mean “we”.  Because it was done in your name, in my name, in our name.  The kids that are return have suffered severe mental trauma at our hands.  The “family values” party really, really sucks at “family values”.  Which is really odd considering how many times the Bible tells us to care for the immigrants among us.

A lot of the families that the Republican Party so gleefully ripped apart were seeking asylum.  Asylum is an entirely legal process where you come to the border, turn yourself in to an immigration officer and request asylum on the basis of persecution or fear of your home country.  It’s legal.  We destroyed families who tried to do things the legal way.  Not every petition for asylum is granted and those people are sent away. But it a legal process, agreed to by international treaties.  I make the point about asylum, because the “terrifying caravan” that has WALKED from Guatemala is the current fear mongering of the President and the reason 11 Jews are dead.

The Caravan started walking during Holy Week to leave their home marred with violence to seek a better life in America. It started as like 7000 men, women, and children. That whole number won’t make it here - they receive asylum in the other countries along the way or give up.  But the ones that do, turn themselves in and request asylum.  Poor, tired men, women and children are now a political scare tactic of the President and Republicans.  For this, the President wants to send more troops to the border than we have in Afghanistan and has said that we could “open fire” on the children.  ON CHILDREN. I would rather send blankets, water and food, and let an immigration judge hear their request for asylum.  

But then again, I’m not the racist asshole sitting behind a Presidential desk.  Nor am I sitting on a couch on Fox & Friends continuing to spew this hateful garbage.  Recently, the President said that George Soros was paying for this caravan.  He’s not. But let’s look at it.  George Soros is a prominent Jew - most people don’t know who he is, but the white supremacists do.  The President’s lie was previously being spread around on Neo-nazi websites and one guy decided he would do something about it and killed 11 Jews in a synagogue and wounded 4 police officers.  That horrific event happened before the President gave it a megaphone.  You can’t say he didn’t know that it was dangerous rhetoric.  People have died and he supported the argument of the crazy guy.  Because he wants to pander to white supremacists.  He thinks that if he gets the white supremacists and you on the same side, then he will win.  That’s who he is grouping you with.  

That’s were the birthright citizenship comes from.  The 14th Amendment is clear.  If you are born in the United States, then you are a US citizen by birth.  It is clear as can be.  The Neo-nazis and the president point to the “jurisdiction clause” saying that illegal immigrants are within our jurisdiction.  Except that they most certainly are.  If an undocumented person commits a crime (which they do are a far lower rate than the current administration), then they can be prosecuted as they are within the jurisdiction of the US.  If they have a child here, then that child is a US citizen. It also comes down to this.  Even if you disagree with how the parents got here.  It has nothing to do with the child.  We do not punish children for their parent’s sins.  Now, if Trump can write an executive order striping the citizenship away from the children of undocumented parents, what is to stop him from striping the citizenship from legal immigrants? But it doesn’t seem like a good idea to argue that you can change the Constitution with a pen.  If he did it, it would be struck down immediately.  But that’s not the point.  Its a hat tip to racists.  It’s using their language.  Giving their arguments the appearance of legitimacy.  This is why white supremacists have become so emboldened under the Trump administration.

We can have a legitimate discussion about immigration, numbers, etc. We can debate an unnecessary $25billion wall paid for by American tax dollars. But unfortunately, you have to get through all of this other crap first.  Because real debate aren’t the arguments the Republicans are making.  Republicans want you to be afraid of brown people.  They think that you will vote for them if you are afraid.  These choices aren’t hard.  Do you want to be a part of the party of fear and hate, or the party of hope?  Unfortunately, the Republican Party is no longer the party of Lincoln, Reagan, McCain or even the Bushes.  It’s the party of Trump and his hate is their hate.  Again. You might not hate immigrants, you might be mad about tearing families apart, or disgusted with the racist rhetoric.

1541199222.0,"White Evangelicals who support Trump should denounce their president's rhetoric against immigrants. If they don't, their God will destroy their churches after listening to Trump spewing total hatred towards vulnerable people coming here in migrant caravans.",6,9tksh4,t5_2qn70,democrats,ihatejoemcCarthy,0.56,"Yes, I strongly want the White Evangelicals who still support Trump to wake up from their slumber and denounce Trump and his rhetoric against the immigrants in general and the migrant caravan in particular.

Because after the way Trump behaved yesterday in his bully pulpit in the White House lying through his dirty and ugly mouth again and again rambling about the size and the content of the migrant caravan which may or may not come near the U.S. border until the end of next year, was totally devilish.

Trump, the Satan's follower told us very clearly that he's using the White Evangelicals for his political purposes, that's all.

His rhetoric yesterday and throughout his campaigns didn't leave any doubts in our mind that if those Evangelicals' who still support their president Trump are doing so at their own peril.

If these fake Christians continue to support a totally evil president who's taking all his cues from the Devil himself, then may be those White Evangelicals should turn their churches into Satanic temples because that's what they're doing by supporting Trump wholeheartedly.

Their God Jesus, that these evangelicals think they pray to, would've destroyed their churches after he listened to Trump in the White House yesterday.

Trump was doing nothing but spewing total hatred towards the vulnerable people coming from Central American countries which are totally devastated by the dictators acting on Trump/Pence cues.

Jesus knows that these dictators in 3 poverty stricken countries in Central America are opening their flood gates allowing their citizens of mainly of women and children to flee in caravans after murdering their husbands and fathers as and whenever they get a call from Trump or Mike Pence.

The fact, that Trump didn't stop paying millions of dollars to these dictators from the U.S. Treasury, tells us what we want to know.

Yes, every Americans should learn the fact now if they didn't learn it before that Trump is using this caravan for his political purposes.

He wants to win this midterms for his Trump party any way he can.

No wonder he's sending 15,000 combat troops to our border towns right now with 5 days before the midterms to stop only migrant children and their mothers as there are hardly any adult men or gang members or terrorists in this mass exodus of vulnerable people of Central America.

He is not telling this truth to our women either saying that there are no adult men in this caravan.

But he had no problem in lying to all of us yesterday that ""Our women are scared of this caravan.  Our women don't want it."" 

But in reality he never told to our women and our men that these are totally destitute women and their malnourished children who're coming in this caravan, walking only 3 miles a day out of more than 900 miles still remaining in their journey for a better life.

The Republicans, who're trying to keep their congressional seats in Tuesday's midterm elections, are in a situation which can be called a rock and a hard place.

Those Republicans who're embracing Trump's rhetoric in the congressional districts in Pennsylvania and others will be sore losers because of what the gunman inspired by Trump's caravan related rhetoric did last week.

We all know that Robert Bowers opened fire on a Jewish congregation in Pittsburgh killing 11 elderly Jews who had nothing to with bringing the migrants to the United States.

We also know that these White Nationalist killers who also killed 2 Black Americans in KY and a bomber who sent 12+ bombs to prominent Democrats in the same week did it because of Trump's propensity towards using violence as a path to his victory. 

These two killers and the the bomber heard the same rhetoric from their messiah Trump who was always promoting violence in all his campaigns to subdue his opponents to earn his presidency.

We all heard along with these killers and anarchists when Trump openly bragged about his supporters' love for him by saying, ""My supporters will still vote for me even if I shoot somebody on 5th Avenue, NY.""

No wonder Trump's supporters are still loving him and are ready to  kill more innocent Americans before the midterms just to show their love for their nihilistic leader. 

They'll stand in line on Tuesday to vote for Trump's anointed Republican candidates in this year's midterms so that their president can turn this country into a killing fields like we saw in Vietnam, after the midterms.

That's why the rest of the Americans like us on the left, mainly the Independents, have to ponder whether Trump's rhetoric is good for America or not ?

We Americans have also to ponder if Trump is dragging all of us towards our doomsday by his scorched earth bombastic lectures to his idiots attending all his rallies.

If we listen closely to what he says in his rallies against the immigrants and the Democrats we can figure out that Trump is instigating his bombers and butchers with AR-15 in his rallies to run amok in our beautiful country and kill more innocent people like they killed or attempted to kill last week.

That is the question which every citizens should keep in mind when they go to the polling booths now until Nov. 6th that is whether to allow Trump and the Republicans destroy America completely or to save our country from their marauding supporters?
