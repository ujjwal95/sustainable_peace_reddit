1360865199.0,Did Obama troll the GOP on the SOTU speech?,0,18i9qo,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,Dogdays991,0.22,"I'm refering to the rumor before Tuesday, that his speech would be highly aggressive and partisan, similiar to or more so than his inauguration speech.  There was a prediction that it would be “less a presidential olive branch than a congressional cattle prod.”

Perhaps I'm naive and giving too much credit, but i thought Rubio and his speechwriters were smarter and developed several responses in advance, and made last minute adaptations as needed depending on the tone.  

I have no doubt that Obama had his tone and outline long in advance, but I wonder if he allowed or even encouraged it to leak that he might be taking an aggressive stance, in order to lead the republican response to set an inappropriate tone, which i think we did see.  It sounds machiavellian but I wouldn't be suprised, would you?

I wonder if Rubio's apparent discomfort and nervousness might be partly due to the fact that he realized too late that he was taking an overly aggressive response to Obama's relatively neutral tone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18i9qo/did_obama_troll_the_gop_on_the_sotu_speech/,0,Republican,2013-02-14 13:06:39

I see him on various daytime political shows all the time these days, and when I do, he makes a very good impression.  He's obviously still very strongly conservative, but comes of as very reasonable and even has a sense of humor, which is very rare from the right these days.  He seems to have the credentials needed for a republican, but in a much more likable package.  

Lately he appears to be making a good career out of being the ""Sane conservative guy"" on the TV circuit, but seems like he should be more highly regarded by his own party.

1411001585.0,Scottish Independence and why you might want to suddenly care.,1,2goajr,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,eclectro,0.57,"So I have been sitting here as an American with a rather Scottish last name thinking about what horse that I have in this race for the Scottish independence vote. When this [rather interesting story passed by me.](http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/09/16/348018843/like-it-or-not-scotlands-drama-may-hit-your-wallet).

Specifically, the notion that it could destabilize the European Union. But who are the people that stand to fear Scottish independence the most? Out of control bankers who threaten the global economy *anyway* - who could really kill the Euro much the same way the American economy almost crashed because of bad banks.

But I digress, if Scotland votes for independence, then suddenly noxious treaties such as the [Transpacific Trade Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership) or more specifically the US-EU [TIPP](http://leftfootforward.org/2014/09/ttip-free-trade-deal-hit-by-fresh-blow/) *become much more difficult* to pass. Treaties that work to short change average citizens in favor of huge monolithic corporate entities. 

So, while the Scottish people would do well to fear the economic consequences of voting for independence, they would do better to evaluate the consequences of voting no. Which is probably a vote yes for continued corporatism run amok that ends up driving down wages (and then jobs) for everybody. Not to mention being bound to the fate of huge banks. Where many have been [maneuvering operations to Europe](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-11/treasury-said-to-monitor-overseas-swap-de-guaranteeing-by-banks) to escape minimal US regulations (even though the regulations are very weak!) For those banks that want to leave an independent Scotland, it really would be good riddance. They're probably doing you a favor if they do so.

In an effort to avoid the political echo chamber, I (a self proclaimed moderate) have been subscribing to subs catering to individuals of all stripes in search of coherent political discussion. 

A few of the right leaning subs I initially subscribed to were a bit too overtly racist, and r/conservative seems to be more reactionary than proposal-based. Are there any conservative subs out there with real political discussion going on in terms of proposed conservative policy, think-pieces, and the like? 

I know this may not be the best place to post this, but I figured y'all are levelheaded enough to handle it.

Now i often try to explain that there were explosive and late developments in 2016 that disturbed the data, before explaining that regardless, one candidate being more likely than the other to win should not cast so much doubt on the veracity of polls or poll averages, like RealClearPolitics. In enough trials the underdog will win, just in this case it happened early.

Those are necessary caveats just to save polling from total unreliability. They knew there was a chance Trump would win. I think the best bet you would make with the bookkeeper during the 2016 election will always be Hillary. However, there is a nugget of truth in that cynical view towards polling in that the practice has become more and more difficult.

Several articles have been published referencing the difficult the census bureau is facing heading into 2020, including a stagnant budget while population increases as well as the increasing prevalence of multi-family houses. These in addition to difficulty had with illegal immigrants since the 80s.

We know the migration to cell phones as the sole device and the increase in telemarketing has both changed the rules for polling and decreased receptiveness to the need, respectively.

What else do we know about where polling is headed?

Obamacare requires everyone to acquire health insurance, and if we don't we'll have to pay an additional penalty or tax.  I looked up the actual penalty to income scale and was quite surprised.  The penalty kicks in at $9,5000 a year for single people, twice that for families, and starts at $695 per person.  The financial projections of Obamacare also now estimate that 6 million people will end up paying the penalty.  Naturally, everyone that can afford to, will immediately acquire health insurance to avoid the penalty.  Am I right in suspecting that the Obamacare Penalty Tax is really only going to be levied on the poor people who really can't afford to pay it?  Is anyone else surprised that we're going to tax people living below the poverty line an additional $695 a year?  

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

1351223157.0,How can Obamacare work in it's current form? Why add demand but do nothing towards supply.,1,122zef,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,seius,0.5,"I've been hearing both sides of the obamacare discussion for months now, either terrified seniors or social democrats with justice in their sparkling eyes. I get the idea, and it's quite lovely, everyone in the country being insured, with equal treatment for all! However, how can we make this happen, and do you really think this will happen under the current act?

I will use my current experience: I am 28, living in New York State. In ten years, my insurance premium has risen 400%, the services I am able to recieve have gone down, It used to be I could get an appointment with my family doctor with a week or two notice, now i can book half a year ahead, and two out of three times I am called that the doctor is not going to be there, and I am pushed to the end of the line 3 months later.  

What I think is happening is that the supply of doctors has remained the same, however the demand set upon them has received a massive increase as the baby boom generation ages. Now, with a massive increase in demand funneled by the affordable care act, the same number of doctors will be working twice as hard for half the pay! 

Quality of service will therefore decrease. This coming in a time when we are seeing record amount of obesity and degenerative diseases that could be prevented with proper education.

I think the reason France's social medicine system works so well is that pharmacists can give out perscription medication in the case of redundant easily identifiable cases, and they don't seem to have the same risk of lawsuit that we see here. If we do the same and allow Pharmacists to write small things like antibiotics, skin creams, etc, and at the same time increase training of doctors and physicians (hopefully backed by the US government and facts not pharmaceuticals and big money) we could integrate a fully functioning medical system for all ... but this plan doesn't really account for the increased load. 

Maybe I'm missing something ... Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/122zef/how_can_obamacare_work_in_its_current_form_why/,24,Republican,2012-10-25 23:45:57

# New Stuff

**/u/ mentions are now disallowed**

To help combat witchhunting all /u/ mentions will be removed by automod.  /r/politics is a place to discuss US politics - not other redditors.

**AMA Requests**

We're glad everyone is enjoying the AMAs!  A lot of you have sent us modmail requesting guests and we're sending off invites when we can.  To make this process easier on everyone we've thrown up a link on the sidebar that you can use to request an AMA guest.  Simply fill out the form and we'll try to get them on the schedule!

*[In addition to the sidebar you can also click here to request AMAs!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPb-2CtL2lIsMo9xOvs6sdQGDymyZ29seWyQsNTJy1oxPthw/viewform?usp=sf_link)*

# Upcoming AMAs

As you've hopefully come to expect, we have several more great AMAs lined up this month. Today, check our other sticky for an AMA with the Communist Party USA! And in the next couple weeks, look forward to:

* June 5th: Andrew Janz, Democrat running for Congress in CA-22

* June 8th: Michael Hartley, Democrat running for Congress in IN-05

* June 13th: Evan Siegfried, GOP commentator and strategist whose last AMAs can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/58oh8f/i_am_gop_strategist_commentator_evan_siegfried).

* June 14th: Chris Cillizza, CNN commentator formerly of WaPo's The Fix

And as always, we're in talks with several more! If there's anyone else you'd like to see, just refer to the sidebar or the section above.

# Upcoming discussion threads.

**SCOTUS Decision discussion series**

We're also looking to bring back some topical discussion threads and are pleased to announce that we'll be running a series of discussion threads on the end-of-session decisions by the Supreme Court.  Decisions are usually read on Mondays so that seems like the most logical day to have them.  Stay tuned for more info.

**Special election discussion series**

Despite not being close to a regularly scheduled federal election, there are plenty of special federal elections, and regularly scheduled state and local elections going on right now. These threads are intended for users to discuss upcoming elections, no matter how small, in detail, ranging from polling, candidate announcement, upcoming deadlines, or upcoming electioneering events - like the New Jersey State Primary on June 6th and the Utah Federal election is November.  More details to come!

Today, November 11th, is Veterans Day in the United States.  Veterans throughout the history of this country have fought and died to protect the rights we enjoy as Americans, including your right to vote for President.

These privileges we enjoy are bought and paid for with our most valuable resources - brave people who put their lives on the line every day and sometimes make the ultimate sacrifice.

The 2016 Presidential election is shaping up to be one of the more interesting this country has seen in decades.  While the candidates and their supporters spend the coming months campaigning for the highest office in the land, we thought it would be fun to take a look at the Presidents throughout our history and how events during their administration impacted politics of their time as well as how they affect the politics of today.

Each week we will feature *at least* two presidents for you to discuss (if discussion goes stale we will move on to the next one early). We'll list a few common things about each one ; age, term, political affiliation, etc.  In addition we've chosen 4 things that happened during the presidents campaign or administration as starting points for your discussion.  In some cases we've chosen those things because they are significant events/firsts in US history.  In others we chose them because we thought those things would be of interest to you, the /r/politics subscriber.

We wanted to keep this simple and relatively easy to set up each week so we didn't write out a bunch of text on each president.  Instead we linked to primary sources (where available) or a wikipedia article in a crunch.  You're more than welcome and encouraged to discuss other events that we didn't list.  Please remember our [comment civility rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_comment_rules) are in effect.  Have fun!

The 2016 Presidential election is shaping up to be one of the more interesting this country has seen in decades.  While the candidates and their supporters spend the coming months campaigning for the highest office in the land, we thought it would be fun to take a look at the Presidents throughout our history and how events during their administration impacted politics of their time as well as how they affect the politics of today.

Each week we will feature *at least* two presidents for you to discuss (if discussion goes stale we will move on to the next one early). We'll list a few common things about each one ; age, term, political affiliation, etc.  In addition we've chosen 4 things that happened during the presidents campaign or administration as starting points for your discussion.

The 2016 Presidential election is shaping up to be one of the more interesting this country has seen in decades.  While the candidates and their supporters spend the coming months campaigning for the highest office in the land, we thought it would be fun to take a look at the Presidents throughout our history and how events during their administration impacted politics of their time as well as how they affect the politics of today.

Each week we will feature *at least* two presidents for you to discuss (if discussion goes stale we will move on to the next one early). We'll list a few common things about each one ; age, term, political affiliation, etc.  In addition we've chosen 4 things that happened during the presidents campaign or administration as starting points for your discussion.  In some cases we've chosen those things because they are significant events/firsts in US history.  In others we chose them because we thought those things would be of interest to you, the /r/politics subscriber.

We wanted to keep this simple and relatively easy to set up each week so we didn't write out a bunch of text on each president.  Instead we linked to primary sources (where available) or a wikipedia article in a crunch.  You're more than welcome and encouraged to discuss other events that we didn't list.

1454719079.0,February 2016 /r/politics Meta Thread,85,44blci,t5_2cneq,politics,pimanac,0.76,"Hello /r/politics,

This thread is for meta discussion of /r/politics as a subreddit.  We welcome questions about the subreddit and moderation policies, suggestions for improvements, and other comments you might have about the sub.  One thing we've not been very good at is giving feedback on what you've brought up in the meta posts and we'd like to rectify that.

**Here are some of the highlights from last months meta thread**

* Concerns over the amount of Bernie Sanders content on our front page.

 > We're aware that there has been a great deal of Bernie Sanders content on our front page and while it may seem overwhelming at times you must remember that /r/politics is a place to discuss U.S. politics.  As Bernie Sanders is a sitting senator and presidential candidate *most* content featuring him is on topic.

 >We want to stress that it's you, the users, that control what reaches our front page.  Simply put - Bernie posts get a lot of upvotes.  The first handful of votes on any submission make or break it so the best way to influence what reaches our front page is to vote on the content in /r/politics/new.  

* Mega threads for polls
 > We've also received feedback asking why we do not create mega threads for poll results and other events that cause dozens of articles about the same subject to be on our front page.  The mod team has been discussing this and recognize that it works for some other subreddits.  However, most subs that do mega threads are not political.  We haven't come up with a good way to implement these while still remaining impartial and giving everyone the opportunity to have their opinion heard.  So - for now we will not be using mega threads.

* Celebrity / non-politician endorsements
 > Several users have requested we disallow celebrity endorsements.  While celebrity endorsements may not be every day politics, it still falls under the purview of our on topics statement.  If seeing celebrity endorsements is something you don't want to see on the front page, your best option is to vote on the content in /r/politics/new.

* Election fatigue
 > A lot of you have expressed that you're tired of seeing the same old election content on our front page all the time.  We are too!  There are many other things going on in the country besides the presidential election.  Of course we prefer to let you control what you see on the front page so again - please make sure to vote in /r/politics/new.

 > However, we have a few other ideas to shake things up a little and give you something to discuss besides who our next president will be.  More on that later!

* Requests to ban sites such as Salon and Breitbart

 > We have no plans to ban Salon or Breitbart at this time.  While we understand both of these sites sometimes write inflammatory stories or use questionable titles both sites are legitimate news organizations on the far ends of their respective political spectrum.  It's only natural that they cause some controversy.

 > Banning a site is a step we take only in the most extreme circumstances and only when it *consistently* produces rule breaking content.  Neither of these sites have done anything to warrant a ban.

* Disable downvotes

 > There are legitimate uses for downvotes, and removing them affect less than 50% of users (more than 50% are mobile users who are unaffected by CSS).

* Making our ban list public

 > We have no plans to make our ban list public at this time.  





**Now for the news**

* Debate Coverage

 > I'm sure most of you have noticed by now that we've been doing mega discussion threads as well as live posts for each of the RNC and DNC debates.  It took us a few debates but we're getting into the swing of things now.

 > One thing we've started to do for the debates is solicit volunteers from the community to help organize and run the live threads.  So far this has worked out very well and we want to thank everyone who volunteered to help!  In addition to soliciting volunteers from our community - during the last RNC debate we reached out to the moderators of each Candidate's subreddit asking if they would like to help with our debate coverage.  Moderators from /r/Rand_Paul and /r/The_Donald pitched in a hand and we thought the night went very well.

 > The plan right now is to continue to invite the moderators from the respective candidate subreddits on debate nights and work with them foster good debate and coverage.  We feel this might give everyone an opportunity to see and work with some of the other political subs on reddit.

* Discussion threads on non-election topics

 > There has been a lot of talk among the mod team about starting a monthly or weekly discussion thread on some topic that relates to US politics.   Basically we want to give you guys something to talk about other than the election and something that isn't day-to-day politics.  Several of the ideas floating around include a discussion series on the US constitution, historic US Supreme Court cases, and discussion threads hosted by moderators of other political subreddits.

 > All of that is still in the planning stages so we would like to get your feedback on the kinds of things you might like to see in a discussion series.  

* New Moderators

 > As most of you know we've been looking for new moderators so we'd like to give a shoutout to our three newest mods:


 >* /u/UnimatrixZeroOne

 > * /u/KarmaNeutrino

 > * /u/strictscrutiny

 > All of them have been doing a great job and we're happy to have them on the team!  Since we put out the call for new moderators we've received hundreds of applications.  Rest assured we're looking at each one of them and will be making decisions as to who we would like to bring on in the coming weeks and months.  Thanks to everyone who took the time to apply.

I have a question in regards to the GOP Presidential candidates.  Are they real?  By that, I mean are they genuine or are they characters akin to Stephen Colbert or other acted out personas?

The reason I bring this up,  no one in politics in other countries are this dense.  Let alone one of the most powerful countries in the world militarily, the United States is a joke when it comes to its front line figureheads.

I am convinced, that people like Michelle Bachman, Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich are all made up persona's to fit an idea of a GOP candidate.

Does the GOP live in fantasyland?

btw, i'm a Canadian just interested in what goes on south of the border.  Our politics are extremely different, and while I may not be a fan of Harper, he's at least got a brain.  I can't say the same for my american friends to the south, and they're the ones holding the big guns.

Why is this okay in American politics, please explain?  They would be laughed right out of the room here in Canada.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n2iu9/are_the_gop_candidates_real_people/,4,Republican,2011-12-06 17:39:34

1384914035.0,Would it be beneficial to create a government entity which can regulate privacy information and rights?,0,1qzrng,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,spurning,0.5,"I'm new to this sub, but this seemed like the best place for this discussion.  I don't claim any special or broad knowledge over the issue, but I am curious about it. 

With everything that has happened in the last year concerning privacy rights, would it be beneficial for there to be some sort of regulating body that can keep a firm eye on the privacy of citizens, both online and offline, and perhaps moderate intrusions into that privacy?  Could it be effective?  Is it financially possible?  

I mention financial feasibility because the NSA operations are already incredibly expensive and I would like to see a portion of their costs transferred over to the new department that I'm discussing.  I'm not sure if it would be effective because this essentially ads another layer of bureaucratic messiness to an already messy process, but that is effectively a check against a currently abusive system.

Thoughts?

Edit: to be clear, I'm asking what it would take to make this happen.  This includes updating privacy laws and potentially consolidating departments of different agencies with similar functions into one separate agency.  I don't have a fleshed out idea of my own, just some thoughts, and I'm looking for more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1qzrng/would_it_be_beneficial_to_create_a_government/,12,Republican,2013-11-19 21:20:35

A special message from Ameripac:

FIRE OBAMA! The Clock Is Ticking!

The voters have spoken!
Obama's Presidency has been a living nightmare for our country. In two short years, Obama has single-handely destroyed our country. From the never-ending stimulus, to epidemic proportions of unemployment, the damage Obama has inflicted on our country is never-ending. Right now, America is at a critical crossroads. The action you take at this moment will determine if our country will survive these dismal times. We must act now to protect our family and our country, because you can bet Obama and his buddies could care less. The countdown to FIRE Obama begins NOW!

Repeal Obama's Bills & Send Him Back To Chicago
SEND FAXES TO ALL 100 CONGRESSMEN!
America has had enough. Now, more than ever, Obama must hear it directly from the people. We will no longer submit to his bullying tactics. We will no longer tolerate his arrogant disregard for us. And we will no longer let him get away with imploding our economy. IT'S TIME WE THE PEOPLE HOLD OBAMA ACCOUNTABLE.

If we ever want to have any hope for our future, we must work together to clean up Obama's trail of destruction-right now! I'm sure your thinking this will be an impossible feat to accomplish. After all, the damage Obama has inflicted on our country is tremendous.

I can't deny that cleaning up Obama's mess won't be tough. But, anything you love is worth fighting for. And I hope you love this country as much as I do. Together, we can battle to repeal each and every toxic bill Obama's passed. How will we do this? We will create an avalanche of groundswell support. We will flood the White House and Congress with a tsunami of faxes. We will let Obama and his buddies know we won't rest until all of Obama's bills are repealed. And we will keep reminding Obama his power trip will come to a screeching halt in 2012.

Repeal Obama's Bills & Send Him Back To Chicago
SEND FAXES TO ALL 100 CONGRESSMEN!
Interested? I hope so. The time is now, for each and every one of us to rise up and fight for what we love: America. You and I know Obama has trampled all over our beloved country. His serial taxing sprees, his addiction to stealing our money and his endless stimulus bills have done enormous damage to our economy. Obama's list of failures could span for miles. But the sake of time, let's begin with debt.

Obama has dumped more debt on our country than any other President in history. What does that mean for you? It means, just for existing- YOU OWE $43,000 IN DEBT! And thanks to Obama's unbridled spending binge, your children and their children's debt could be three times that amount. Even more enraging is: YOU haven't received anything in return for giving Obama a huge chunk of your paycheck. Does the government pay for the food on your table? Probabally not. But, Obama is paying the grocery bills for 41.8 million people. Your tax dollars are funding the greatest robbery in history.

Repeal Obama's Bills & Send Him Back To Chicago
SEND FAXES TO ALL 100 CONGRESSMEN!
What does this massive amount of debt mean for our country? Since there is no way we can repay our debt we will either default on our loans or experience a cataclysmic inflation hike. If we default on our loans, our credit rating will plummet and everyone who owns treasury bonds will lose their savings. In addition, thousands of pension funds will be worthless, and tens of millions of Americans will have their savings wiped out. Better keep an eye on your bank account, because you could be next.

If inflation keeps heading towards the clouds, our money will be virtually worthless. That means we could experience Soviet-style food prices. I shudder when I imagine a fifty dollar price tag on a banana. If you think that's shocking, take a look some numbers.

Obama's Explosive Record of Debt

    * $26.2 Trillion: Estimated Debt in 2020
    * $13.6 Trillion: Current National Debt
    * $3 Trillion: Debt Obama Has Crushed America With Since Taking Office
    * $868.4 Billion: Debt America Owes To China
    * $831 Billion: Interest Payment On Debt In 2020
    * $1.23 Trillion: Debt In 2009 (The Highest Debt In History)

Pretty scary. But that's not all. Let's take a look at the collasal mess of ObamaCare. I'm sure you'll never forget how Obama and his cronies steamrolled this bogus bill into law. ObamaCare is just another example of the blantant disregard Obama has for each and every one of us.

Repeal Obama's Bills & Send Him Back To Chicago
SEND FAXES TO ALL 100 CONGRESSMEN!
The aftershocks from ObamaCare are starting to shake our country. Private companies are planning on dropping their worker's insurance coverage to help them swallow the bloated price tag of ObamaCare. Health insurance companies are already dropping coverage like flies. Utah-based Intermountain Health Care won't insure healthy kids anymore. You can be sure other companies will follow suit.

ObamaCare: The Price Tag Will Make You Sick

    * $2.5 Trillion Dollars: The Price Of ObamaCare
    * $575 Billion Dollars: Dollars ObamaCare Will Steal From Medicare
    * 30: Number Of Waivers Obama Gave Companies So He Could Avoid Letting People Know ObamaCare Will Cause Them To Lose Their Healthcare
    * 80%: Percent Of Small Businesses That Will Have To Change Healthcare Plans To Pay For ObamaCare
    * $569.2 Billion Dollars: Number Of Secret Taxes In ObamaCare

And it's not just ObamaCare that's draining our wallets. Obama's never ending ""stimulus"" has left our country in ruins. We have mile long unemployment lines, record numbers of people who have stopped looking for work and and no end in sight for the Recession. Even with an $18 million dollar website, Obama and his friends can't make their harebrained idea to resussitate our economy work.

The Stimulus: A Sinkhole Of Filled With Your Money

    * 2.6 Million: The Number Of Jobs Lost Since The Creation Of The Stimulus
    * 8.8 Million: How Many People Sank Into Poverty Between 2008-2009
    * 1.2 Million: The Number Of People Looking For Work
    * 6.1 Million: The Amount Of People Unemployed For Longer Than 27 Weeks
    * $18 Million: The Cost Of The Stimulus Website

It's no secret, we are living in scary times. It seems like ages ago when we had a sane President who helped our country prosper. Sadly, those days are over. Since Barack Hussien Obama's election, our government has been overtaken by gangsters. And we all know, Obama and his thugs don't plan on changing their ways anytime soon.

Obama has turned our country upside down in two short years. And I guarantee he will continue to wreak havoc on our way of life for the next two years. So, it's up to each and everyone of us to take action. If you share my beliefs and believe America is worth fighting for, I ask for your support today. Time is ticking. We need the immediate action of patriots like you to repeal Obama's lethal bills. Let's send him packing back to Chicago in 2012.

I am ultimately against corporations and business taxes. I think businesses don't pay taxes, people do. At the same time I think when one business pays a tax and another doesn't that is market cronyism; another behavior I have problems with. I don't see why the NLB should pay taxes and the NFL be tax exempt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1qkdll/on_the_fence_about_nfl_tax_exempt_status/,16,Republican,2013-11-14 00:42:49

The poverty rate is 44%, the crime rate is about the highest in the country, kids are in a gang by default based on the block they grow up on, the primary thing the kids worry about when getting out of school is drive-by shootings. The murder rate in Englewood is 62 per 100,000, five is the national average. 

We could start them at 1st grade into boarding schools before they learn the ways of gangs and violence. The boarding school could be out in the country, or possibly a few miles away from the area the parents live. The boarding school option could be a way to end the cycle of poverty and violence they grow up in.

What would be the problems of such a public school? What would be the political obstacles? Or is it just a question of where to get the money?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1lrqdm/what_would_be_the_problems_involved_in_sending/,10,Republican,2013-09-05 10:35:49

His electoral weak point included traditionally religious communities, of course this wasn't the only factor but maybe it was one. 

Could a Democrat who emphasizes the more ""hippie"" side of Jesus - non judgemental, helping the poor, service and self sacrifice - into an argument for a more robust welfade state win the nomination and then presidency? 

Of course he would have to take a progressive stand on abortion and LGBT issues to win the primary, but many Christians do that already.

On the other hand the economic side might be easier to swallow for moderates if paired with a Christian underpinning. 

The activist/progressive wing could be turned off by overt religiosity but maybe if it was used in the service of policy goals they like, they would find it a natural Alliance.

[Constitution Analysis & Interpretation, see Page 49](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2013/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2013.pdf)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional\_Apportionment\_Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment)

This is the first of the first 12 amendments, and the last (of two) of which that was not originally enacted in the 1790s, and the last of which that is still outstanding. The 27th Amendment was other one that wasn't originally enacted. Since Congress never created a deadline for it, it is still technically pending and could still be ratified.

It's believed to have been ratified by 11 states (The Wikipedia source returns a 404 and I couldn't find any others, however I have no reason to doubt this claim. Thing is, I can't find any state legislature records from this time period. If someone could point me in the right direction, that would be great), the last of which was Kentucky in June 1792 (again, I couldn't find a source for this but I have no reason to doubt it). It would need to be ratified by another 27 states.

It creates a formula for setting the size the House and its districts. If it were to be enacted today, the required size of districts would be no more than 1 representative per 50,000 constituents. For context, the average ratio of representatives to constituents now is 1:700,000. Based on the 2010 census, that would be about 6,580 representatives (\~328,000,0000/50,000).

Would requiring some fraction of the previous major election (I.E. Presidential or midterm election) voter participation for the voted on topic to pass be a terrible idea?

---

Ex.

Say school board X wants to issue debt to build a new stadium. Say there are 100k registered voters and 60k of them participated in the presidential election last year. 

If the fraction was set at 1/3, then that would mean 20k people have to vote in the election for it to be considered legitimate election. If 20k didn't end up voting, then no action can be taken because there wasn't the threshold participation.

Could a requirement like this be beneficial for governance and legitimacy?

In recent decades, the Senate, when it wishes to debate such a bill which the House has not yet passed, will take another bill which was passed by the House, gut it, and replace it with all, or nearly all of the bill that they wish to vote on.  Questionable practice or not, this has become an accepted part of how Congress works these days.  

Now, arguments are popping up that, because this is how the Senate version of the Healthcare law was passed, it violates the Constitution.

So, my question is; 'What is the precedent?'  Is there any instance of a bill which was passed in this manner being successfully challenged or defended in court?  How high did it go?  Has SCOTUS ever ruled on the practice?

Obama will have a Republican house for sure.  Romney will likely have a Democrat run Senate.  (EDIT, current odds are 52-48 in favor of the Democrats).

If Obama wins, he'll ask for the Bush tax cuts to be made permanent for the middle and lower class and let the upper run out.  If the Republicans balk, he'll call their bluff and let them all run out, and then introduce a middle and lower tax cut that the Republicans can try and commit political suicide opposing.  I imagine it will go through.

Romney is elected.  He tries and re-instate all of them?  The Senate won't have it.   They'll only re-instate the lower end.   He lets them expire and tries to pass his whole program?  The Senate states they'll only do the lower end.  

Or maybe he's able to pass the huge tax cut plan, but doesn't get the deduction bucket of 17k passed?  Can we imagine that the Senate might allow that?

EDIT:  This question is quite broad, and so I understand there is plenty of discussion of how do we want to define ""value"", and ""public"" and ""private"".    I am thinking of the endless debates we have of letting the ""free market"" work, or how we should have the ""government"" provide for universal healthcare.   The problem is there are a variety of ways you can slice these issues.   

Instead of talking ideology and philosophy, surely we can talk specific examples.  What shows success and why?  

Here's a random article I selected that ranks countries:
http://totalbuzz.ocregister.com/2011/09/29/u-s-ranks-no-1-in-low-taxes-military-spending/64163/

It says Finland is best in education, why?  (We're 26th)  It says Japan and Switzerland are the best in health, why?  

If the issue is they don't have diversity, can we control for that and see how we compare?  Do we have a better educated wealthy population?  Do we have a better educated middle class?   

I'm just trying to spur substantive discussion.

1346720423.0,Let's try and select the 10 worst congressmen,1361,zaci9,t5_2cneq,politics,jemyr,0.9,"Okay, already I see we should do this a different way.

Your first comment should be the nominee, including your top reasons why they are the most egregious congressman.  People can chime in below with more info pro or con.  ONE NOMINEE PER COMMENT, so the votes count.

**EDIT 1:**  I should say congresspeople, but it's too late to change the title.

**EDIT 2:**  I just intrduced the topic of how we are going to define what ""worst"" is.  Is it corruption?  Saying stupid things?  Hypocricy?  What is it?  Additional edits to the edit:  (IN THE COMMENTS **PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT CORRUPTION**, so think about who you think is the most corrupt politician in Congress).  This isn't to say we still can't vote for people because they are egregiously bad or insane, but if you can show corruption, your nominee has a much bigger chance of winning.  And don't you want them to win?  ;)

**EDIT 3:**  One hour in 13 nominees so far.  There are 435 Congresspeople, how many of those are an embarrassment  to the political process?

**EDIT 4:**  CURRENT LEADERBOARDS 7 hours in:   So it looks like we should have different lists  (Tell me if this is a bad way to break them up)

1) Corruption/crime (Joe Barton leads, apologized to BP)   

2)  Obstructionism over Problem Solving (Eric Cantor leads, pretended to faint over raising debt ceiling after he had done so 19 times under Bush... and I will state here it makes no rational sense that there aren't more Democrats nominated to fit this bill).   

3)  Conspiracy Generators/Truth Twisters (Darrel Issa leads for making Fast and Furious a democrat conspiracy.  This is taking real issues and making them partisan and conspiracy oriented).

4)  Ridiculous (Michelle Bachman leads,  this group is for people who foam at the mouth and talk nonsense, like holding anti-american trials.  They drum up debate on things that aren't in the national interest.)  

5)  Incompetent/Not capable of rational decision making  (Jesse Jackson Jr leads, who clearly needs to take a leave of absence)  

6)  You don't agree with their politics.  (Lamar Smith leads.  He's against the free internet and marijuana... simplifying, I'll take him off this section if people reply with stuff that isn't just disagreeing with his politics).

**EDIT 5:  Current nominees in order of votes at 8 hours in:
Mitch McConnel, Eric Cantor, Michelle Bachmann, Joe Barton, Lamar Smith (more nominations at the bottom), Darrel Issa,  Jesse Jackson Jr, Todd Akin,  Steve King, Joe Walsh,  Jim Inhofe,  Joe Wilson, Joe Lieberman,  Lindsey Graham,  Hank Johnson (thought Guam would tip over with too many people on it),  Sheila Jackson Lee,  Paul Ryan,  Kevin McCarthy, Maxine Waters, Joe Walsh, Diane Fienstein, Thad McCotter,  Vicki Hartzler, Debbie Wasserman Schultz,  Louis Gohmert, Peter King, Barbara Boxer, Pete Stark,  Jeb Hensarling,  Richard Burr,  Patrick Leahy,  John Boehner.**

Non individual nominees, but with 49 votes total for the group:
    Representative Robert Andrews - D
    Representative Vern Buchanan - R
    Representative Alcee Hastings - D
    Representative Don Young - R
    Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr. - D
    Representative Jean Smith - D
    Representative Joseph Crowley - D
    Representative Gregory Meeks - D

**EDIT 6**:  Of note is that Charlie Rangel and Steve Allen, who had previously been mentioned, but not officially nominated, have now rocketed up the list.  Charlie is now holding to place 11.    Also, there are a lot of people who keep re-nominating Lamar Smith.  Apparently he's made an impression.

**EDIT 7**:  Alright, we're about to fall off the reddit cliff.  

At nearly 24 hours here are the nominees in three groups:

**GROUP 1: Corruption/Criminals/Extreme Liars**  

1.   Mitch McConnel (R- KY - Senator) :  Giving millions in earmarks to BAE while it was actively being tried in many countries for buying political influence.  

2.  Joe Barton - Apologized to BP.

3.  Jesse Jackson Jr  (D) - under investigation for trying to buy a senate seat.

4.  Darrel Issa - Accused of arson for insurance profiteering, among other things.

5.  Charles Rangel - tax evasion, using position to gain money.

6.  Vicki Hartzler - go look

7.  Allen West - tortured an Iraqi police officer that he had taken into custody.

8.  Jim Inhofe - climate denier that takes lots of money from interests that want global warming denied.

9.  Sheila Jackson Lee - went to Michael Jackson's funeral on taxpayer's dime.

10.  Thad McCotter - among many other things, faked his nomination papers to be put on the ballot (three times in a row).   

**GROUP 2:  Posturing/Obstructionism/Spin Machines/Severe Bullying/Party over Problem Solving and the Well-Being of the nation:**

1.  Eric Cantor (R - VA),  pretended to faint when voting for the debt limit  under Obama after voting for it 5 times under Bush.

2.  Mitch McConnell -  only goal is for Obama to lose.  

3.  Darrel Issa -  conspiracy generator for self promotion over solutions.

4.  Joe Walsh - said his double amputee opponent was playing the war veteran card.

5.  Vicki Hartzler -  too numerous, go look

6.  Sheila Jackson Lee - voted meanest on the hill by staff

7.  Joe Wilson - ""You lie!""

8.  Lindsey Graham - couldn't think how to summarize

9.  Peter King - destroy all muslims, basically.

**GROUP 3:  Stupid, Ridiculous, or not of sound mind:**

1.  Michelle Bachmann (R - MN) - pretty well publicized

2.  Todd Akin  - you can't get pregnant from rape.

3.  Jesse Jackson, Jr  (D)  - falling apart

4.  Steve King - said kidnapping a girl, raping them, and making them have an abortion across state lines wasn't illegal.  And we should do something about it.

5.  Vicki Hartzler - go look

6.  Allen West  ""72 out of 80 of the members of the house or representatives are communists""

7.  Jim Inhofe - climate change isn't real because God creates the weather.

8.  Sheila Jackson Lee - too numerous to list

9.  Hank Johnson - thought Guam would tip over if you put more people on it.

**GROUP 4:  You don't like their politics (this wasn't what I meant when we started):**

1.  Lamar Smith (R - TX ) :Against the free internet and marijuana legalization.  

2.  Lieberman:  wanted a kill switch to turn off the internet.  Plus many are still mad he went independent.

3.  Paul Ryan

Had those with power and influence simply left enough scraps behind to keep me just a bit overwhelmed, as I have been most of my life, I would never have had the time to look up from my duties and see what the wealthy elite are doing to us.  I would have continued on in my programming forever believing that all the homeless are lazy and all the rich are smart and work hard.  Now I see the grey areas and the very, very black ones too.

I can't cite the legalities of this but it seems wrong at the very least to obscure votes from those who cast them.

Second, it is designed to be an even split between D and R which IMO explicitly rejects third-party representatives and gives an unfair bias toward whatever party happens to be in the minority.

I think its a disingenuous argument because from what I've seen on reddit, it's been done to deflect or excuse the injustices that go on today. Just because BLM doesn't talk about black on black crime doesn't mean they dont care. That would be like saying that a cancer group doesn't care about AIDS because they don't raise awareness for that group.


If you really care about crime within the black community, great. But to say that we in the black community don't care about our own killing is just untrue. There are many groups in major cities that do raise awareness. But mainstream media never talks about that.

If they made more jobs and pay for those workers grew as well, the IRS grants them a cut in taxes for a period of 3 years. The process would repeat itself after the 3 years.

ONE SIMPLE QUESTION.  PASS IT ON AND ON AND ON.
         Paul Hollrah
<supposed picture of Paul Hollrah>

While I've little interest in getting in the middle of the Obama birth issue,  Paul Hollrah over at UTFSM did so yesterday and believes the issue can be resolved by Obama answering one simple question:

What passport did he use when he was shuttling between New York , 
Jakarta, and Karachi?

So how did a young man who arrived in New York in early June 1981,
without the price of a hotel room in his pocket, suddenly come up with the price of a round-the-world trip just a month later?

And once he was on a plane, shuttling between New York , Jakarta , 
and Karachi , what passport was he offering when he passed through 
Customs and Immigration?

The American people not only deserve to have answers to these questions, they must have answers. It makes the debate over Obama's citizenship a rather short and simple one.

Q: Did he travel to Pakistan in 1981, at age 20?
A :Yes, by his own admission.

Q: What passport did he travel under?
A: There are only three possibilities…
1) He traveled with a U.S. Passport,
2) He traveled with a British passport, or
3) He traveled with an Indonesian passport.

Q: Is it possible that Obama traveled with a U.S. Passport in 1981?
A: No. It is not possible. Pakistan was on the U.S. State Department's 
    ""no travel"" list in 1981.

Conclusion:
When Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a 
British passport or an Indonesian passport.

If he were traveling with a British passport that would provide proof 
he was born in Kenya on August 4, 1961, not in Hawaii as he claims. 
And if he were traveling with an Indonesian passport that would tend 
to prove he relinquished whatever previous citizenship he held, British 
or American, prior to being adopted by his Indonesian step-father in 1967.


Whatever the truth of the matter, the American people need to know 
how he managed to become a ""natural born"" American citizen between 
1981 and 2008...

Given the destructive nature of his plans for America, as illustrated by 
his speech before Congress and the disastrous spending plan he has 
presented to Congress, the sooner we learn the truth of all this, the better.

If you Don't care if Your President is not a natural born Citizen and in 
Violation of the Constitution, then Delete this and go into your cocoon.

If you do care then Forward this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9ubwj/email_from_birthers_about_passport_issue/,14,democrats,2009-10-15 17:35:27

In particular, California seems like a great state for Democrats to use as a sort of mascot for a states' rights agenda. While I certainly disagree with Democrats on a lot of issues, I think it would be good for them to stick up for local and state governments. It wouldn't just provide a good justification for their rebellion against President-Elect Trump; it would also break apart the notion that only Republicans care about the states.

538 did a really good analysis of that position:

http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruz-has-a-huge-math-problem/

Basically, just because a Person is high in the polls, they may still not win many delegates based on how spread out their supporters are, or how various states conduct their Primaries.

Does this qualify as a ""break down in Democracy""?  I hear that a lot, that in a true Democracy whomever has the most votes wins.  But in the Republican, and the Democrat race, there are many caveats that determine who the eventual nominee will be.  Is that perfectly fair?  I think it is...but I am interested to hear what you all think.

At its closest point the amendment was merely one state away from the three-fourth's threshold but was soon forgotten about with the admission of more states. As it stands it'd need approval from twenty-seven states to become law. No states have rejected it.

Here is a [letter from Alice Walker, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Wolf, Oliver Stone, Danny Glover, Jody Williams, Tom Hayden, Patch Adams, Glenn Greenwald, Juan Cole and other prominent Americans](http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/node/1312) if you are interested in learning more about this issue, with many sources and citations.

It is my feeling that we are making terrorism worse, not just through airstrikes, but the 'War on Terror' in general. We are going to be leaving Afghanistan very soon, having largely failed in our mission. The country will likely fall back under Taliban control and the moderate people of this country will be facing horrific conditions.

We worry about Iran, but Pakistan already has the bomb, and with Afghanistan goes most of the leverage that we had in this region.

Most of the people that live in the communities that we are bombing have nothing to do with any conflict with Western nations. We are turning them against us. For every leader that we kill, we create many new enemy fighters.

I am not naive, well, at least I try not to be. I know that there is little chance that this initiative will stop the 'Robot War'. I do believe that this issue should be part of our national discussion and this is why I am asking for support with this petition.

We are one day condemning violence against chidden and authorizing orders to kill them the next. We have sanitized war and reduced the cost of killing to the point where there is not enough incentive to bring it to a natural conclusion.

It is said that the USA is in a war every 20 years. We will soon be looking at a war that lasts 20 years.

I posted this before, and hope to continue to raise awareness and encourage discussion for what I believe to be a very important topic.

I know there are those that believe that petitions do not work. Legislation begins with petitions, it is how initiatives get on ballots. Progress is slow, but in a democracy, discussion and awareness are very important. If you discourage participation, then I believe that you are working at odds with the democratic process.

Some believe that a civilian who is not actively engaged in beltway politics has no business taking a stance regarding national defense. Activism is often started by those with no political connections, and more often than not, policy is determined by big corporations who promote their own self-interests against which 'We the People' are the only line of defense. The 'Occupy Movement', the anti-war sentiment during the Vietnam era, and other examples of individual activism are very important to the political process.  

tldr; We are creating more terrorists than we are eliminating through airstrikes. We are killing children and the elderly, If you do not believe that this is what this country should stand for, please sign the petition.

EDIT: Thanks for the discussion. I will continue to try and keep the discussion going on Reddit and other forums.

There is nothing in modern history to back up that lie.

I would like to think that you realize that we need roads, schools and electricity and that if you turned that all over to the private sector, many children would be left with no education, you would pay a toll on every road and kids in South Central LA would be reading by candle light.

It is OK if you just don't care about other people. It is selfish, but it is not illegal.

But please stop hiding behind this lie that Republicans are good for the economy. Unless of course you have data to back it up. Thus, my challenge.

EDIT: Forst off, sorry for the inflammatory tone. I realize now that is not helpful. US debt is [falling](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-debt-load-falling-at-fastest-pace-since-1950s-2012-06-08) faster than at any other time since the 1950s. Economics and politics is a bit like ping-pong, with one president passing his mess to the next, so it is tough to sort some of this out. There were booms under Reagan and Clinton, and it is hard to say how much of this was due to policy.

However, this idea that Republicans are better for the economy is really not true. You can shake it any way you want, but Bush 2 left us in the worst state since the great depression that a democrat got us out of. And the depression was really bad. My family was pretty well off, owned a general store, and even they had to ration meat.

Is it taxes? Because taxes went [down](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/01/barack-obama/obama-says-taxes-lower-middle-class/) under Obama. 

All that really seems left is social issues. Is that what we are talking about here? Abortion, gay marriage? Evolution in schools? I would really like to believe that this is not the case.

Is it social programs? Do you really want to take money away from seniors, disabled people, single mothers trying to raise children? 

Health care? Is that it, because we are (one of) the only civilized nations that doesn't consider getting cancer meds a right?

Help me out here - I am happy to look at centrist viewpoints, but I really fail to see the logic. I understand the libertarian stance of keeping politics out of my life, but we need schools, roads, no? 

It seems we could make room for the national endowment for the arts, but hey, if that is it we can let that go. I had someone from the CATO institute tell me that that particular figure is so low it gets rounded out of the equation - but if we can do without something, I guess that is it, oh and NASA.

EDIT: I know the bikini graph has progressed from the link above, but truth be told, Bush dug a deep hole, and Obama un-dug it.

EDIT2: Well, looks like the thread ran its course. Interesting how people responded to this. I am good if conservatives say that they make their decisions based on their social values, that is certainly their right. How you can look at a guy that needs cancer meds and say, no you have to die at 20 when you could otherwise live to be 70, because you didn't get health insurance is beyond me. How you can walk past an elderly homeless person and think, yeah, tough luck buddy - also escapes me. I would like to think that we stand for more than this.

1402219224.0,The response I got from NY Senator Chuck Schumer when I wrote him on Net Neutrality and the FCC,47,27l6v4,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,staiano,0.8,"Dear staiano:

Knowing of your support for an open and accessible internet, I wanted to update you on recent net neutrality activity.  Today, June 5, 2014, I submitted a comment to the FCC proposed rulemaking on net neutrality highlighting how important it is for Chairman Wheeler and the Commission to consider the significant public input that they have already received, as well as how important it is that the Commission promulgates final rules consistent with the principles of an open internet.
 
This is in addition to a letter I recently signed with ten of my colleagues in which we implored Federal Communications Commission Chairman Thomas Wheeler to craft meaningful rules that will prevent blocking, ban discrimination, and promote increased transparency in the Internet marketplace.  I was encouraged to see that after receiving our letter, the FCC has decided to include specific questions targeted at the development of more robust rules that will protect net neutrality.  In the wake of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia’s recent decision vacating Commission’s 2010 Open Internet Order, it is clear that that the need for explicit, enforceable rules has become even more urgent.  
 
I believe that access to the internet should be affordable and readily available to all Americans, and I am glad that the FCC is leaving all options on the table while developing a way to ensure that the Internet remains free and open to everyone.  I have urged the FCC to listen to the voices of the thousands of New Yorkers who have commented on the proposed rule.  The already overwhelming response to the proposed FCC rule underscores just how important this question is to Americans in their everyday lives, and I will continue to fight to ensure that their voices are heard, and to protect net neutrality for all.
 
Again, thank you for contacting me regarding this important issue. Please feel free to contact me in the future if I can be of further assistance on this or any other matter.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Charles E. Schumer

United States Senator

We could have a discussion about how to improve elections and avoid these issues, but I think that it is more relevant and pressing to discuss how these issues are handled and rectified. Should a vote be thrown out due to procedural mistakes by administrators? Should imperfectly filled out ballots be recorded or simply thrown out?

1541751182.0,What role does the design of the ballot play in an an election?,11,9vfimm,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,ILikeBigButtss,0.99,"This question is inspired by the current state of the tightly contested Florida Senate race. In Broward County a [large number of ballots did not record a vote in the senate race.](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article221344365.html) One proposed explanation is the [layout of the ballot](https://cdn.ballotpedia.org/images/7/74/Florida_sample_ballot_%28Broward_County%29.pdf) resulted in people being more likely to skip over the Senate race. It is also possible that the was a machine error in scanning the ballots.

The 2000 Presidential election in Florida famously had an issue with the [butterfly ballot](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/the-butterfly-did-it-the-aberrant-vote-for-buchanan-in-palm-beach-county-florida/AB4BE772AE12CB20D7D8EB7CF5ED130A) design which was claimed to confuse voters and result in their vote being recorded differently than intended. The election was decided on the issue of whether or not a vote should be recorded as marked on the ballot or as the voter intended.

[In Minnesota in 2008, Al Franken beat Norm Coleman for the U.S. Senate seat by a sliver, less than 300 votes. In that race, almost 4,000 absentee ballots were not counted because the envelope was not signed.](https://www.propublica.org/article/disenfranchised-by-bad-design) This may have been partially attributable to instructions that voters had trouble following.

The Brennan Center has [detailed several instances of poor ballots that may have affected votes](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Democracy/VRE/Better_Design_Better_Elections.pdf)

What should be done to ensure that votes are recorded accurately and as intended? The voter obviously bears much of the responsibility and should be diligent and double check that their ballot is properly filled out. Elections officials must also be responsible for creating a ballot that is easily understandable for voters. However, elections are often overseen by political officials who may not know how to create a good ballot and may have motivations to influence election outcomes though the ballot design.

What can be done to ensure that the ballot is as fair and accessible as possible? Should there be a national standard for ballot design? What should be done in the instance that a ballot design is a decisive factor in an election? Should the votes stand as they were cast, or should an effort be made to record the votes as they were intended to be cast? The current case raises further issues. The voters did not raise an issue when they submitted their ballot with no vote in the Senate race and it could be argued that if they intended to vote in the race, they would have raised an issue then. It does not seem fair that an election can be swayed by a particular jurisdiction's use of a ballot that unduly dissuades or promotes participation in a race.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/9vfimm/what_role_does_the_design_of_the_ballot_play_in/,10,democrats,2018-11-09 03:13:02

1468922539.0,Would holding Oxford-style presidential/VP debates be better than the current format?,92,4tiqj0,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,chilaxinman,0.87,"The US branch of [Intelligence²](http://intelligencesquaredus.org/) (IQ2US) started their \#FixTheDebates [campaign](https://youtu.be/Qz2P4pzerPU) to implore both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as well as the [Commission on Presidential Debates](http://www.debates.org/) to use the Oxford style of debate over the moderator-centered or town hall styles that we usually see. If you're unfamiliar with the Oxford-style debate, here's a [really short video](https://youtu.be/xVmShH0-9xY) from IQ2US that explains it. The [IQ2US petition page](https://change.org/FixTheDebates) has more information about why they support the change.

So, like the title asks, **would holding the debates in the Oxford style be better than the status quo?**\* Is there an alternative debate format you think is more ideal or do the debates work fine as they are? Do the debates even matter enough in elections to worry about how they're run or is that kind of trivial?

*I mostly mean ""better"" in the sense of whether or not the voters would benefit from it, but I'd also be interested to hear any technical, practical, or whatever concerns anybody thinks of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4tiqj0/would_holding_oxfordstyle_presidentialvp_debates/,42,democrats,2016-07-19 06:02:19

2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Donald's open sanctioning of torture
 
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - Muslims or Mexicans take your pick.
 
4. Supremacy of the Military -  N/A
 
5. Rampant Sexism - Donald's sexism is a matter of public record
 
6. Controlled Mass Media - Donald is advocating being able to sue any media outlet that writes something bad about him.
 
7. Obsession with National Security - Donald has played the terrorism card over and over again.
 
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Donald frequently questions the faith of his opponents and has even had a fight with the Pope over faith.
 
9. Corporate Power is Protected - One look at Donald's economic plans will show you that.
 
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Donald favors taking down the unions.
 
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - In fairness Donald shows a lot of disdain these are just among them
 
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - A major part of his campaign
 
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - N/A
 
14. Fraudulent Elections - Donald hasn't directly been involved but his party is frequently responsible for fraudulent elections and stealing voter's rights.

Later on they used the code words ""state's rights"" as a way of nicely wording their opposition to civil rights for all.

They have used it as well with their ""pro life"" position which really represented forced birthing and denial of woman's rights.

The list goes on and on and now the latest favorite word is ""political correctness"".

Yet the reality is the GOP and Conservatives are talking and using the word with much more sinister connotations.

What of Sayed's brother Syed Raheel Farook who served in the Navy for four years? Does the FBI break down his door take him out back and shoot him?

1354411956.0,Why the GOP is holding up fiscal cliff negotiations by refusing to make a counter proposal to the President's plan.,11,143y65,t5_2cneq,politics,njmaverick,0.65,"President Obama has done what you expect to have done in a negotiation.  He made a proposal with increased income by letting the tax rate for the wealthy go to the level it was at back during the Clinton boon years and he looks for savings from last year's budget cuts, reductions in medicare spending and savings from the end of the wars.  

In traditional negotiations the ball would be in the Republican's court.   They now should be making a detailed counter offer so that negotiations could move forward.   Only the GOP has not done that.  Instead of they have done is ridicule the President's plans and offered up platitudes about closing special interest tax loop holes and reduce spending.   

There is a good reason the GOP doesn't want to make a detailed counter proposal.  The reason is that the American people would hate what the GOP wants.   The GOP owes the billionaires and big corporations who spent over half a billion to get them into office or keep them in office big time.   So what the GOP wants is to make their wealthy benefactors happy.  That means they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthy   Now they claim elimination of deductions, but financially that's about as effective as spitting on a five alarm fire.  The truth is the increase in tax rates will raise tens of billions of dollars a year while the loop hole closing would be lucky to raise a billion and that is if you harm the nation by eliminating things like tax deductions for charities (which would cripple not for profits and churches).  

To make up for the money lost by not raising taxes on the wealthy the GOP would like the poor and middle class to bear the burden.   The GOP wants huge cuts in Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits and Medicaide benefits.  They want to gut or cripple most of the federal goverment with huge draconian spending cuts that would again hurt the poor and middle class.

So now the GOP having to stake out a position that is contrary to the interests of America and most Americans has no desire to share that position with the American public.  What they will try to do, and this will only make going over the so called cliff more likely, is stomp their feet and pout and make vague demands and hold their breath until the President makes all the horrible proposals they want to see passed.   

After all one thing the GOP has no interest in is accountability for THEIR actions.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/143y65/why_the_gop_is_holding_up_fiscal_cliff/,9,democrats,2012-12-01 20:32:36

1347740610.0,Choosing a President- When did ideology trump character,5,zx8sx,t5_2cneq,politics,njmaverick,0.56,"Watching Romney get heckled VA for being a horrible human being that put American lives on the line while he tried to score cheap political points and seeing the crowd start a mindless change of ""USA"" ""USA"" in response to a very important and powerful question, I was struck by the question about what happened to character.

Our history is filled with Presidents who were of the highest character. George Washington was known for never telling a lie, Abe Lincoln was known as honest Abe, Eisenhower was know to be a solid man and so on. Now I will give you that a detailed study of history will show all these men were flawed human being (as would be expected), but that's not the bigger point. The bigger point is that the American people felt good about the overall character of these men. They were for the most part good honest men that people felt comfortable in knowing what they were getting and that the men could be trusted. 

How can anyone say that Mitt Romney is a good man, an honest man or a trust worthy man? After all if we look at those three traits.

A good man- What we have seen from Mitt is he started life as a prep school bully, went on to become a vulture capitalist meaning he got rich by hurting others and finally he even tied his dog to the roof of his car.

A honest man- Latest studies show that he has lied over 600 times in bid to be president

A trustworthy man- The man who's changed his position so many times that he is known as etch-a-sketch leaves voters with no clue what he stands for and what he is all about. Besides his proven track record of telling people what he thinks they want to hear, he also has shown himself to be an opportunist who will do anything to get what he wants.


One would think a man of such low character and lacking in ethics and morals wouldn't stand a chance getting elected do catcher. Yet because he represents (at least that's what he is telling people) a perverse blend of conservative ideology and far right religious dogma over 40% of the American people are saying they would vote for him.

4 years ago we were in a great depression and there were millions of jobs lost every month.

Freedom:


Bush- Creates Patriot act, Reduces woman's right to choose, Weakened separation of church and state

Obama- Allowed gays to serve openly in the military, ensured equal pay for women, protect woman's right to healthcare


Healthcare:


Bush- Price of care sky rockets as health and insurance industry operated unchecked, increasing numbers of Americans no longer have insurance or can afford care

Obama- Created checks on rising health care costs and has helped millions get health insurance


Economy-

Bush- Allowed economy to crash and nearly destroyed by not providing proper financial oversight and regulation. 

Obama- Saved the economy, created millions of jobs and saved the nation's auto industry



Energy and Environment


Bush- Denied global warming, encouraged wasteful energy consumption and tried to drill in environmentally unsafe areas

Obama- Has started renewable energy initiative, encouraged energy savings and efficiency, has worked to reduce green house gas emmissions


War and Foreign Policy and Safety

Bush- Allowed the worst terrorist attack in our history on 9/11, made our nation an outcast, illegally invaded Iraq over a lie, started the disastrous war in Afghanistan 

Obama- Ended the war in Iraq, kept us safe: no terrorist attacks on US, killed OBL, improved our reputation world wide



Justice 


Bush- Appointed Supreme Court Justices that took away our political voice by burying it under billions in unregulated money from corporations and billionaires (mostly that we pay for with tax deductions) through the Citizens United Ruling, Now allows police to strip search us for speeding ticket or getting arrested at protect

Obama- Appointed Judges that opposed the Citizen United Case and the Strip Search ruling.

Not only do they have to pack four days of material into three, but at 7 am on Wednesday hurricane Isaac, which may be a cat 2 by then, slams into three red states.  

So the GOP will be bashing the president and government, while the president will be on national TV coordinating government assistance to storm victims in Republican states.  You can bet the president will do more than fly over New Orleans in Air Force One.  

Some of the same governors who ripped on the president and the federal government will be in the unenviable position of receiving federal disaster assistance while Mitt Romney is accepting the GOP nomination on Thursday.  

At a minimum the big news is going to be the weather and not the convention.  

This close on the heels of the Akins comments and the whole abortion dust up the Romney campaign now walks into 72 hours of potentially disastrous optics.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yx6hd/the_disastrous_optics_of_the_rnc_convention/,8,democrats,2012-08-28 00:21:20

However, I have an issue with the individual mandate I was hoping Reddit could clarify for me. I'll state that I don't have much of an issue with the idea of government making people buy insurance to lower medical costs. It's a good idea in theory. However, there is a major potential problem I do have with it. Right now, millions do not have health insurance because they cannot afford it. How is forcing people to buy a product they cannot pay for going to help them? Seems like it might put an undue financial burden on people, considering how my family cannot even afford insurance right now (even tho we will likely be covered in another couple months). Is anything else in Obamacare going to ensure that health insurance is affordable? As thing as, forcing people to buy a product they cannot pay for and then punishing them financially because they don't seems as messed up and backwards as the No Child Left Behind idea of having schools lose funding because their test scores are too low. Anyone know of anything in the healthcare law that will make insurance affordable for all so that we have no excuse not to get it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rhqn0/question_about_individual_mandate/,10,democrats,2012-03-28 20:39:51

1355968864.0,What if the Republicans WANT to go over the fiscal cliff?,0,154aaa,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,sokpuppet1,0.48,"I've been thinking about this. Yes, taxes go up and defense spending is cut, two things Republicans hate. But that's not all-- nearly 90 billion is cut from domestic programs that help middle and lower class Americans, as well as Medicare, funding for the arts and sciences, etc. These are all things the Republicans have wanted to cut for a very long time. 

The taxes? Cutting them will be easy after January 2nd. Even if Republicans don't get lower taxes for millionaires like they want, they'll still be able to say they voted for lower taxes. Defense spending? That's always been an easy sell in Washington, and chances are the funding will quickly increase, especially if we come under another attack.

The other cuts however, the cuts to Democrat-supported programs... those will be very hard to reverse. In the long run, the Republicans get what they want-- smaller government. And if the economy does crash and burn, they can claim it wasn't their fault-- after all, Obama got the tax plan he wanted, and the Republicans cut government spending to help move towards a balanced budget.  Enough people will believe them.

1327388416.0,My Senator's Two Responses to my PIPA Letter - 4 Months Apart - ,2,otjm2,t5_2cneq,politics,Rakajj,0.67,"I sent my two Senators here in NY letters about PIPA and its dangers.  I sent the same letter twice, once in July and once last month in December.  Here is the response I got in September when Schumer got around to responding to my letter I'd sent in July.

>Dear Mr. -----:
 
>Thank you for your contacting me in opposition to S.968, the PROTECT IP Act. Like you, I believe that consumers should have access to a vibrant and innovative online community to discuss their ideas and opinions.  At the same time, we must not let the internet become a haven for intellectual property thieves.
 
>The threat to intellectual property owners over the internet is clear. Every year, the US Chamber of Commerce estimates that copyright theft costs our nation about $58 billion in lost output, 373,375 in lost jobs, and $16 billion in lost employee earnings. These numbers present an unacceptable burden to US businesses. In addition, companies may be less likely to innovate because their products may be stolen by intellectual property pirates, creating a drag on the US economy.
 
>The PROTECT IP Act addresses the problem of intellectual property theft online, but it also contains important due process protections to ensure that legal activity over the internet is not disrupted.  As you may know, the PROTECT IP Act would allow the Department of Justice to file a claim against a website that 1) has no significant purpose other than engaging in or facilitating copyright infringement, circumventing technology controlling access to copyrighted works, or selling or promoting counterfeit goods or services; or (2) is designed, operated, or marketed and used to engage in such activities. A judge would have to find that a website is intentionally violating intellectual property rights of an American entity before he could issue an order against that site. I believe PROTECT IP Act would provide law enforcement and intellectual property holders additional tools to protect American intellectual property from websites while still ensuring the constitutionally protected rights of free speech and due process. The PROTECT IP Act currently is awaiting action on the floor of the Senate, and I will continue to monitor this bill as it moves through the Senate.  
 
>Thank you for contacting me on this important issue.  Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can ever be of assistance to you on this, or any other matter.  
  
>Sincerely,
 
>Charles E. Schumer United States Senator


**That letter was very much a Pro-PIPA response.  Here is the response to the same letter sent to him in December...**


>From Dear Mr. ------:
 
>Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about S. 968, or the PROTECT IP Act of 2011.
 
>Over the last several weeks, I heard from many of my constituents who, like you, had severe concerns about the PROTECT IP legislation being considered in the Senate.  I take those concerns very seriously, and I agree with you that we need to find a better way to address the very real problem of internet piracy — in a way that doesn’t do anything to damage our dynamic tech community or freedom of expression on the Internet.
 
>Senator Reid’s decision to pull a vote on PIPA from the Senate calendar was the right one and will allow Congress to work with stakeholders to craft a better solution that protects the American jobs threatened by illegal online piracy, and at the same time encourages the growth of New York’s vibrant and growing technology and Internet communities.
 
>Thank you for contacting me on this important issue.  Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can ever be of assistance to you on this, or any other matter.
 
>Sincerely,
 
>Charles E. Schumer
United States Senator

This is effectively the best we could hope for from a former PIPA supporter.  I'm very proud of my fellow NY'ers that contacted Schumer to get him to change his stance on this and it's reassuring to see our efforts having some real effect.  

**TLDR: I mailed letters to my Senator in July and December, the first was responded to in a Pro-PIPA way the second in an Anti-PIPA way showing that our efforts are at least having some effect.**

I've been wanting to do something like this on my own for awhile but due to part laziness and part busy-ness I've put it off.  It occurred to me last night that having multiple people work together on it would probably result in a higher quality product at the end as we could check each others logic...sources...arguments, etc.

Obviously we have a pretty wide variety of viewpoints here so the Libertarians probably wouldn't want to be writing position papers with the Socialists...but there are enough of each I'd presume for multiple groups to form.  

Just a thought.

1306943838.0,"Forming a ""Taskforce"" / ""Coalition"" / ""Think Tank"" / ""Group""  to Draft a US Constitution for the 21st Century",1,howzt,t5_2cneq,politics,Rakajj,0.67,"I know it's an ambitious idea, but how many of you would be interested in a group effort, through a moderated Wiki or something of that sort, to draft something akin to an updated version of the US constitution.  This is obviously a large project that would take a lot of time and discussion as to the intent of the original text of the current Constitution and how that might be adapted.  

Ideally, the /r/Politics community as a whole could collaborate on something like this, rather than having the various ideological subreddits do it individually although I can imagine that would result in a more expedient process.  Instead of just getting upset over the latest politician's inane rambling, we could collectively study, consider, and address the issues of the 21st century that were simply not around in the late 18th century.

In before ""Constitutional Lawyers spend their lives arguing about these things, you expect to do it with a group of political hobbyists?""     

-Yes, in short.  Our end-result doesn't have to be perfect or completely agreed upon, but it could promote some much needed discussion.  Think about how long our Constitution has lasted and how dated it is, compare this with the French who have had numerous constitutions, the latest of which has 18 Amendments to it already since 1958.  

Also: From what I've seen, a lot of people are of the ""We don't need a new constitution, we just need to follow the one we've got!"" mentality.  Which is a fine stance, but I respectfully disagree that a 200+ year old document is sufficient to guide our Supreme Court and base our Laws on.  If you think our current constitution is fine, I'm happy for you but many of us simply disagree.  

Thurgood Marshall said in a speech in 1987 ""the government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights, we hold as fundamental today.""

“I believe that, as long as there is plenty, poverty is evil.”

“Gross National Product measures neither the health of our children, the quality of their education, nor the joy of their play. It measures neither the beauty of our poetry, nor the strength of our marriages. It is indifferent to the decency of our factories and the safety of our streets alike. It measures neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our wit nor our courage, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worth living. It can tell us everything about our country, except those things that make us proud to be a part of it.”

“Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.”

“Each time a man stands for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”

1320391933.0,"Libertarianism, as a political system in modern USA is fundamentally unfair and morally and ethically wrong.",12,lzlzi,t5_2cneq,politics,OkToBeTakei,0.54,"while i did not write the text below, it perfectly echoes my views on Libertarianism, esp. Ron Paul. This is originally taken from a Google+ post by John Kinsey:

>""All right, a lot of obvious libertarian/Ron Paul supporters have added me to their circles. And I assume that my opposition to (my understanding of) libertarianism (and by extension, Ron Paul. Although, c’mon, the dude doesn’t even believe in evolution. It’s the 21st century people, get with it), I thought it would be helpful to just lay out as clearly as I can my problem with the libertarian position. I have already done so several times, but I thought I’d give it another go. 

>First (and I’ve said this once already, but) let me define what I mean by the word ""fair""
""Fair"" is treating people in similar circumstances the same, and treating people in different circumstances different. If you have two perfectly healthy legs, then it's fair for me to expect you to walk up the stairs to get to my house. If your legs don't work, however, then it's fair for you to expect me to make accommodations, such as building a ramp, so that you also can get to my house. You get the idea. 

>The attraction of Libertarian ideology is that it proposes that all people be treated the same. 
The problem is that people aren't all in the same circumstances. Indeed, unless you’re a heterosexual, white, protestant male, you're probably well aware of the structural inequity that permeates our current social arrangement. So, when Libertarians propose simple, blanket solutions (that are almost, without fail, only fairly applied to heterosexual, white, protestant males) they are, in fact, proposing solutions that are simply not fair. 

>In short, I find the position generally naive and poorly informed about the reality of the global (and domestic) social arrangement. There is egregious structural inequity, and that, from my prospective, is what this movement is about. As such, I see libertarian attempt to co-opt it into a Ron Paul political movement as somewhat ridiculous. 

>But, maybe it would be helpful to elaborate a little more about what I see as unproductive (or inaccurate) with the libertarian position. First, it seems that for libertarians, the concept of freedom is limited to the idea of ""freedom from."" For them, freedom means simply freedom from the ""initiation of force,"" or the ""non-aggression against anyone's person and property."" The notion that real freedom must combine both freedom ""to"" and freedom ""from""is missing in their ideology, as is the social context of the so-called freedom they defend.

>In right-""libertarian"" and ""anarcho""-capitalist ideology, freedom is considered to be a product of property. As Murray Rothbard puts it, ""the libertarian defines the concept of 'freedom' or 'liberty'. . .[as a] condition in which a person's ownership rights in his body and his legitimate material property rights are not invaded, are not aggressed against. . . . Freedom and unrestricted property rights go hand in hand."" [Op. Cit., p.41]

>This definition has some problems, however, insofar as to it's application to contemporary American (or, for that matter, global) society. In such a society, one cannot (legitimately) do anything with or on another's property if the owner prohibits it. This means that an individual's only guaranteed freedom is determined by the amount of property that he or she owns. This has the consequence that someone with no property has no guaranteed freedom at all (beyond, of course, the freedom not to be murdered or otherwise harmed by the deliberate acts of others). When one tries to argue this position in a country that, for example, was founded on slavery and, as a consequence, laid the framework for who is and who isn’t a property owner along racial and cultural lines, such an argument is, to be frank, laughably naive. 


>It seems that a distribution of property is a distribution of freedom, as the right-""libertarians"" themselves define it. It strikes me as strange that an ideology that claims to be committed to promoting freedom entails the conclusion that some people should be more free than others. Yet this is the logical implication of their view, which raises a serious doubt as to whether libertarians are actually interested in freedom at all. It seems to me, at this point at least, that libertarians are less interested in protecting freedom and are more interested in preserving white privilege and the structural advantages that white, male, heterosexual, protestants enjoy. 

>So, first, if you read all the way through, thanks. Bear in mind this is meant as a conversation starter, not a shut down of voices I don't agree with. I will, however, not repeat myself over and over anytime I think the conversation digresses into something I've covered here. Rather, I'll just point back to this posting and ask you, if it's relevant, to first address the objections I've laid out here. 

>I shall now brace for the predictable onslaught of angry libertarians and Paul supporters. Bear in mind, however, that I'm an atheist who is earning a PhD at a seminary. I'm quite used to speaking to groups that disagree with me, and I never back down against what I see as wrong. I will, however, concede a legitimate point that is backed up with evidence. I may not believe in gods, but I do believe in reason.

That narrative has been pushed by [Callum Borchers of the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/07/how-the-media-grades-donald-trump-on-a-curve/). Clinton surrogate Lanny Davis has suggested an ""undisputed"" [media bias against her](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/07/hillary-clinton-and-undisputed-media-bias-against-her.html).

Similarly, [The Media Elite](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Media_Elite.html?id=aU4Ff-8AKN0C) (Robert Lichter, 1990) has been the touchstone communication research book for people who claim that the media has a bias towards liberal thought. Justin Raimondo, a conservative pundit, has similarly accused the media of being [unfair to Trump](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-raimondo-trump-media-bias-20160802-snap-story.html).

Further still, there's a narrative that the media has a [neoliberal bias](http://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/etd/622/). The case is made that this links to a [substantial media bias against Sanders](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11378858/sanders-media-bias).

Journalists have a concept known as [journalistic objectivity](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/bias-objectivity/lost-meaning-objectivity/)- which some journalism schools will teach as a combination of [depersonalization and balance](http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/STS218/media/objectivity.html). Further still, there's a trend towards a [""data journalism"" school, as practiced by the NYT Upshot, Vox, and FiveThirtyEight](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/22/upshot-vox-fivethirtyeight-data-journalism-golden-age), which seeks neutrality through data-backed arguments. Even this has been perjoratively labeled [""line chart liberalism""](https://jasonlefkowitz.net/2014/01/against-line-chart-liberalism/), given the bias inherent in curating the data that's presented to the reader.

* Does this journalistic objectivity matter, and if so, how much? 

* Does it matter more or less when voters are closer in time to being asked a ballot question? 

* Are there certain journalistic methods that are more objective than others? Are journalists suppressing legitimate dialogue by selecting those methods?

* Does overtly agenda-driven media get a pass?

* Are there ways that a government can regulate or deregulate media that could change the ethics of an organization's journalistic objectivity?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/51xpb7/does_the_media_have_an_obligation_to_treat/,71,democrats,2016-09-09 18:34:52

[Deontological concerns](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/) are also raised, with some [contemporary conservative voices arguing that the moral character of the vote itself is what matters](http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2016/07/17420/), and likely some voices on the left as well.

This is the letter I just placed in the mail to the supreme court this morning. I am a heterosexual man from Texas, and honestly I'm sick of the only people in our nation with the power to end this senseless discriminatory attrocity sitting on their old wrinkled asses like a bunch of nutless geriatric douchers. But my one letter will be easy for them to ignore. I'm sure they've already ignored hundreds of letters which I have no doubt were more eloquent, intellegent and passionate than mine. So /r/politics I'm asking you for help. It wouldn't take you long to write a page saying you support gay rights. It wouldn't be hard to compose a compelling argument for it. If you don't want to write a letter because you don't care or are lazy then shame on you for being lazy, (although I can't be to mad at you because I'm lazy too.) If you don't want to write a letter because you DISAGREE, well it's just to fucking bad that you're an idiot. But I honestly don't think that there is anyone intellegent/sane left in America who doesn't agree with this. If we all pitch in, and make our voices heard we can make an actual difference, to actual people that actually matter! Come on /r/politics! Why can't the revolution start on the internet?",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o0zcu/dear_rpolitics_help_me_make_a_difference_for_one/,1,democrats,2012-01-03 14:02:42

I've been giving a great deal of thought to this, especially in the face of real decent people I know who are believing and spreading outright lies. Though Obama's context was in the scientific community, in relation to climate change. 

Whatever the topic, the internet has turned information on its head. It is frighteningly simple to find a source of (mis)information for almost any position one may choose to take.

Is this a problem?

ganging up takes away a person's right to have their opinion heard... no matter where i have gone on reddit i keep running into this behaviour... not so much in aww or gifs but anywhere someone might have a personal opinion... well... forget about it if any of these gang members disagree... the gang is called and before you know it they are all in there naysaying and also downvoting the thread so it disappears from the public eye....
it really is not fair...

soo anyway...  it appears it is just going to be more of the same old same ole on reddit and the internet... and i am still sick of seeing that trump word ...so i will leave the internet and go into the world and work for my candidate in real life.. get out the word and the vote  :D  the best vengeance for this onslaught of abuse: winning in real life !",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4e2dn5/i_am_sick_of_seeing_the_word_trump_everywhere_i/,44,democrats,2016-04-09 22:26:03

Haley wasn't fully clear on why she is resigning now, only mentioning her previous six years as Governor of South Carolina and referencing her support for term limits for public offices. President Trump gave her glowing (albeit somewhat awkward) remarks, touting what he believes are significant foreign policy achievements made under Haley's watch.

So what should we expect from Haley going forward? She stated she has no intention of challenging Trump during the 2020 GOP presidential primaries (but only time will tell). However, I have seen rumors of a possible move towards the Senate, possibly if Senator Lindsey Graham replaces U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. If Graham replaced Sessions, the current Governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster (who served as Lt. Gov. under Haley) could appoint Haley to fill Graham's seat in the Senate. Others still predict she will make a presidential run as soon as 2024.

Additionally, who will likely replace Haley as UN Ambassador? Trump mentioned that there are ""many"" people who want the position, but he did not mention anyone in particular. Should we expect a more hawkish appointee, from the same camp as former UN Ambassador and current National Security Advisor John Bolton?

And what can they do about it?",246,95nbe0,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,Hawkeye720,0.91,"As many of you know, last night was the hotly contested OH-12 special election, between Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson and Democratic Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor. The vacancy was created when then-Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-OH) resigned in January to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable.

This race was viewed as another bellwether special election, testing the bounds of the predicted #BlueWave in the coming midterm elections. Much like the PA-18 special election earlier this year, the race became surprisingly competitive, despite the general partisan lean of the district. OH-12 was notably drawn to be a generally safe-R district. In 2016, Tiberi won with 66.6% of the vote, and the district has not been represented by a Democrat since the 1980s. According to 538, OH-12 has a partisan lean of R+14.

Yet, last night, Balderson ended up ahead by only 0.9% of the vote, with \~3500 provisional ballots still left to count. That would be a Democratic swing of 13pts., in line with the other major swings we've seen in the special elections held since Donald Trump took office. That brings the average Democratic swing in the post-Trump era to D+15. Additionally, last night showed Republicans losing further ground with suburban voters, as O'Connor beat Balderson in the Columbus suburbs by over 30%.

As many commentators noted last night and this morning, there are close to 70 GOP-held House districts that are less R-leaning than OH-12, many of those covering heavily urban/suburban areas.

So given this new data point, how worried should the GOP be about a blue wave election? Are they likely to face a massive swing like 2006 or 2010 (for the GOP)?

Jordan has been a firebrand defender of President Trump, most recently by joining with current HFC chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) to file articles of impeachment against Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein. However, Jordan has also garnered some really bad press with his role in the ongoing investigation into sex abuse at Ohio State University, having been accused by several former students of knowingly disregarding the ongoing abuse while he was an assistant wrestling coach at the university. On top of all this, as a member of HFC, Jordan has clearly established himself as an ardent, far-right conservative, often coming to blows with the establishment wing of the House Republican caucus.

So how will Jordan's bid for speaker play out? Can he garner a majority support within the caucus? And if not, how will his bid impact the likely bids by current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise?

1255142337.0,The GOP has been reduced to an opposition party in the truest sense- they're just like communist parties.,7,9siib,t5_2cneq,politics,thefugue,0.64,"As a person who was involved in the anti-globalization movement, I've had a lot of contact with Marxist, Communist, and Anarchist parties and their organizing techniques.  I've also read countless red newspapers, and as a journalist I can't help but read into writing techniques and political theories practiced there in.  May I make an observation:

I never found anarchists or green parties satisfying in opposing mainstream political parties, who clearly work largely for moneyed interest.  Communist parties, on the other hand, have a policy of always producing arguments that denounce **whatever** policies the official government parties endorse, always from a working class prospective.  This is useful in many instances (they were 100% right about much of what Bush's policies would amount to and they were the only effective critics of Clinton and the de-regulatory, pro-corporatist policies his regime ushered in).  That said, when the government DOES make sane decisions this policy becomes absurd and annoying.  I recall that one Trotskyite party decided to advocate for Baathist victory in Iraq (no matter how bad our presence there was, for shit's sake, Hussein was aweful!).  Better examples would be available if I went and found a copy of *Worker's World* today, but I digress.  For instance, I can guess that the initiative to protect homosexuals from hate crimes will be somehow twisted into ""capitalist opportunism"" and ""anti-revolutionary"" compromise in the next issue of *Challenge!*

Which brings me to my point.  It's clear that the GOP has become a party of pure agitation for the rich and the elite. Any policy that opposes the democratically elected, popularly supported government is allright with them.  It's been noted elsewhere that they find themselves on teh same side as terrorists and islamofascists a lot lately, and that's no surprise.  Reading *Drudgereport* or *The Wall Street Journal* or *Newsmax,* it's surreal and insane: No one could possibly believe that tax cuts could help in an economy this depressed (they never have) or that global support for the U.S. is somehow counter to U.S. interests, yet there these people are making these arguments openly.  It's clear that they've become commissars of the rich- they make these arguments on behalf of their supposed constituents simply because they have **ALWAYS** made these arguments. No one sane or in touch with reality takes them seriously, but if they stop they're all out of a job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9siib/the_gop_has_been_reduced_to_an_opposition_party/,0,democrats,2009-10-09 22:38:57

1421788655.0,Should Charlie Hebdo publish a drawing that is critical of the Catholic Pope's mother?,0,2t1q0e,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,ravia,0.49,"The Catholic Pope (usually referred to as the Pope, just as Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, is often referred to as The Prophet without specifying religion) has said that he would punch someone who did a ""yo mama"" about his mother. Should Charlie Hebdo resist this by providing an offensive cartoon that disparagingly depicts what would be unmistakably be the Catholic Pope's mother? 

When the Catholic Pope says ""punch"", what does this mean? In a religion that trucks in a significant degree of metaphor and parable, might ""punch"" be taken to mean something else? I sense that he was giving very much a real world example. However, were Charlie Hebdo to produce such a caricature, this would extend beyond some one-on-one interpersonal circumstance, so might we say that in that case a proper ""punch"" in response might amount to a few people getting killed? Would that amount to a ""punch"" given that degree of publicity? 

This hypothesis of implied violence, probably not meant by the Catholic Pope (IMO), may actually be somewhat implied, nonetheless. This appears to me to indicate at least a certain fraternity between the faiths, as well as an endorsement of the logics of violence (as coercion). While this is not an easy matter, I do think it needs to be thought about. Again, my own sense is that the Catholic Pope didn't really mean that the ""large scheme of things"" version of an insult to his mother would entail a ""punch"" that would involve killing. On the other hand, as I likewise have indicated, it's not at all clear that this isn't either what is indicated or what many would look upon and think, ""Well, yes, that's about what a punch ought to be, sure a few people got killed, but to me, that is about right for a punch, at that level...""

This invokes fundamental questions concerning violence. In the logic of  a serious nonviolence, which the Catholic church does not really lay claim to in a direct way, one response really is to refuse to punch the one insulting one's mother. Raping her in an alley, maybe, but even then, only as a way to protect her, but not as a way to coerce the rapist into not raping someone, one's mother or anyone. This comes with thinking through nonviolence, since if we avoid raping simply to avoid being ""punched"", or killed, or otherwise violently stopped, we really aren't avoiding raping for the right reason, are we? 

This logic of nonviolence, which can indeed be spun out of the example of the punch, is of considerable significance for the issue of extremist violence, less extremist adherence to religion that proscribes violence, etc. Likewise, it should be clear that the Catholic Pope's ""punch"" ultimately does probably indicate a ""just war"" ethic, which in any case has been there all along in Catholicism and Christianity in the main. And this brings into relief a general problem regarding the responses to extremist Islamic violence, as well as the violence incurred as ""collateral damage"" in the international (AKA US led) responses to the Islamic State and other extremists.

President Obama (who is not Catholic, but who is decidedly Christian) has tried to envision, prophetically and between the hard work of authorizing drone strikes, a new direction that the world must take: a ""war against war"". We may well imagine that such a plan could prove to be as successful as the war on drugs. In any case, this Vision might amount to applying more of a punch to those who promulgate war, which might really amount to just more of the same just war thinking. And that thinking, I suggest, may well be inherent in the Catholic Pope's way of dealing with the question of the cartoon that is either offensive to a religion or which does not adhere to its adherent's recognized practices, which is the main thing for Muslims the world over: the prophet of Islam is not to be depicted at all, disparagingly or not. The Catholic Pope didn't really hit this off in his example. Perhaps a better example would have been to say, ""My family has decided to excommunicate my mother, and therefore we never speak of her, disparagingly or not, so if someone else goes ahead and speaks of her, we will punch them."" Or perhaps, ""My mother is such a saint that we in my family hold her to be beyond words, therefore if anyone outside of my family speaks of her, I will punch him or her (or if they are gay, too)."" 

In any case, none of these examples even begin to think through nonviolence adequately, which is, I believe, what is most needful as regards a more decisive and fundamental change and amelioration of the problem of extremism, totalitarianism, religious and other oppression. This can not be in the form of a punch here or there, or a war against war; it must involve an original and originary thiking of and in nonviolence. Perhaps these are fitting words around the time of Martin Luther King, Jr. day, given that what few remember was King's endorsement of a deep nonviolence that went well beyond a few tactical moves. Few like to remember the love that was meant and intended towards even the worst bigots. Such a love, one must imagine, would be steadfast and nonviolent, yet resolute and unflagging, in appealing to an insult to one's mother, yet would be far more inclined to be punched than to punch, since to punch would help to maintain the logic of armed peace that fails to understand that love and respect must arise of their own, and our primary task is to create the conditions of possibility for this. These conditions are not coercive; they are not threats; they are not punishments, either worldly or divine; they are not the referral of our vengeful impulse to harm over to some deity who does it for us, to our smug, private satisfaction in the auspices of conscience. They are the engagement in the cofounding conditions of truth, thought, love and action in which we dwell already, however much we may forget these. Remembering them were an essential part of King's thoughtaction. And forgetting them is what the Catholic Pope did in his well-meaning, but poorly considered example. 

So should Charlie Hebdo parody the Catholic Pope's mother? In my view, they either could do so or not, but it would have to be done in the right spirit and thought, which I do not think they have. Such thought would be more concerned with other critical and metacritical causes, pertaining to these issues of thoughaction, truth, love and nonviolence. While they ultimately are in play in their style of acerbic wit, I think they make that wit do far too much duty for other work that languishes, largely because of either the domination of these central issues by religion or the great forgetfulness that lies in the intellectual traditions.

To do so or not, depending on the spirit. Already this is an insult, not to the Catholic Pope's mother, but to his example, and the nature of examples in general, and judgments of right and wrong actions. This may be a clue for what is at stake here. 

I know what you are thinking: ""Well, what if someone insulted *your* mother?"" I might begin by putting it in perspective. Let's consider an extreme hypothetical: what if, for example, she were eviscerated in front of me as a small child? Even then, I would suffer blows as a way to resist before punching someone, unless they were right in the process of doing so, I think. I would have little doubt that such eviscerations took place precisely because the effort to stop them from external, violent force would only feed the illusions of violence: false remorse, false compliance, false empathy. Ultimately those would be the causes of the evisceration in the first place, just as the sort of person who really would punch someone because you said something about their mama is often enough the kind of person who is all to prone to other violence.

1421248196.0,"I am not Charlie Hebdo, and here's why.",0,2sdn90,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,ravia,0.32,"I think there is something wrong headed about how they are going about this issue. On the one hand extremism, and not just extremism, but the many prescriptions for violence in Islam, needs to be confronted and resisted. On the other hand, not observing a particular convention does not seem to be appropriate, the convention being the depiction of the Muslim prophet. Something doesn't make sense here. It just so happens that they have a particular practice of non depiction. That in itself is something to be respected, while the response of murdering people for those depictions is wrong. So in a sense both sides are wrong, as regards depiction.

It seems to me that CH and supporters are fighting the wrong fight by making an issue of depiction. In that respect they are attacking with a certain violence when they depict. They are quite simply not respecting the religion. This is not to say that the religion should not be critiqued, or that its totalitarian impulses should be respected or observed. Those impulses are indeed there as far as I can see, because while there are some passages which entail respect for other religions - although I don't know what the attitude is supposed to be for atheists - there are other passages which clearly amount to narrative oriented to taking over the world.

It seems as though it might be better to deal with the idea that there is no god but Allah, that is, the very idea of a monotheism. And Islam is not the only monotheism in the world. This amounts to saying is that, on the one hand, I respect your religion and practices, but on the other hand, I actually don't respect the core tenets of your belief, or, rather, I don't believe them. What does it mean to not believe what another believes, and what does it mean for someone to have this belief that is, frankly, irrational (in my estimation)?

But this throws us back into a basic argument between theism and atheism. Just as some attention turns to the everyday Muslim as regards supporting the prescriptions for violence within Islam, this issue throws us into bringing attention to the basic condition of belief and adherence: it means asking, ""so you really believe that this is the one God and that is the creator and all other people are doomed, etc.?"" This is a well-known condition as regards certain kinds of faith. The question might be, why isn't this activated more? When someone says they are of a certain faith, should we become silent as we are often told to do? I believe it was Christopher Hitchens who pointed out that when people nod their heads approvingly when others in their activist group proudly announce that they are in a kind of faith activism, the people approving of this are making some kind of mistake. Perhaps religious faith and non faith are living alongside one another too comfortably. Should it be so easy for someone to really take up a whole system of belief that has, to be blunt, a lot of BS in it? Should we sit there and talk to them when we know that they are in the process of organizing the whole world, and us, as a part of some grand narrative that we know entails a totalitarian goal, a project of conversion of the whole world, a process of categorizing everyone in the world, way of deciding who is who, who gets into heaven, etc.?

And yet at the same time, even in that context, we are given to a certain respect. Should we be so respectful? Does it amount to violence or something somehow unacceptable to seriously question that directly? And what is the difference between doing that and drawing a picture of their religious leader and then drawing a mustache on it or tearing a picture of, say, the Pope in half? What happened after Sinead O'Connor did that on national TV? That SNL episode was bigger than the Coneheads. What was the reaction? She did suffer quite a lot of shunning, which is a kind of violence in its own right. But there is this difference between doing a kind of symbolic action of violence, a violence to symbolism itself perhaps, and directly and substantively challenging or expressing disagreement with something. That means something like saying, ""I won't draw a mustache on your guy, but I think that what you are doing in believing that line of thought is wrong and I am compelled to say something about it again and again and again. You might not murder me unless I do draw a mustache on your guy, or simply draw him, as the case may be, but what happens when I respectfully and nonviolently refuse to cooperate with your belief, not simply by my believing what I believe while you believe what you believe, but my refusing to sit in the same room with you without saying out loud, hey, wait a minute, you're organizing the whole world in this really elaborate religious process thing that you have going on, and I sense it, and I think it is wrong, and I know that you're walking around organizing the whole world that you see around you into the saved and the unsaved, into the good and the evil, into those who are in your faith and those who are not, and the whole thing exudes side effects of various kinds. Furthermore I know that the texts that you read and the devotion that you carry out have definite prescriptions for violence, and these make you more tolerant of other violence is in the world, and there is something wrong with all of that, and I am obliged to say something about it and to do so again and again.""

This is very problematic, as we know. We could say that to preach what apparently amounts to a certain atheism runs the risk at the very minimum of being obnoxious. On the other hand, many mile-a-minute preachers have worked very hard to raise their faith by inculcating people into their mentality precisely by going on and on and on. And there are many ways of going on and on, only some of which depend on speaking at length; others do just the opposite: maintaining a rather forceful silence that is used to preserve a certain sanctity of certain beliefs, i.e., that which is so important that we do not even speak of it. Whichever way a faith is maintained, the question is, should we be going along with it as much as we are? But, at the same time, if we choose to go against that grain, is it still ever appropriate simply to badmouth the religion? If the Muslims have a thing about depicting their prophet, should we be depicting it, should I use a capital ""p"" when writing ""Prophet""? Or is this really missing some important? Does this amount to a certain violence?

It is interesting that things have gone this way in a milieu, nearly worldwide, that has shown that it is uniquely incompetent as regards non-violence in particular. The Arab Spring that was supposed to be something turned out to be a monstrous disaster, aside from Egypt 2011 and Tunisia. Why? Because the thinking people of the rest of the world did not support nonviolence adequately. The truth is that nonviolence is the only way change will happen in the Arab world. Now, it is most interesting that the challenge that Charlie Hebdo has made to Islam has taken the form of this essentially mild violence to Islam. But it has not embraced a more serious nonviolence. Instead, it is trucking in a fairly pedestrian use of religious symbols and, especially, assumptions, as is the tendency where comics are concerned. Restricted in their range of expression due to space, tending toward short statements and meme-like expressions, comics at best lack the nuance, distinctions, and painstaking expressions that are necessary for addressing fundamental issues concerning faith, violence, and world affairs. Indeed, comics are very prone to caricature, to the inflammatory, to helping produce the cartoonish reality that tends to dominate the world of politics.

Indeed, it might be said that Charlie Hebdo is itself another form of religion. Tending toward the iconic, toward the symbolic, toward the caricature, it appears to be more of a piece then it realizes. I am not a Muslim, but I don't know that I am Charlie Hebdo either. I also don't think that people who say they are Charlie are really truly Charlie Hebdo; the only people who can lay claim to that are those who actually do depict the prophet of the Muslim religion. I should point out that it is strange when we hear this referred to simply as the Prophet, rather than the prophet of the Muslim religion, rather like referring to ""The Church"", rather than a particular church.

This whole problematic must still refer to fundamentals of nonviolence. But we know that everyone knows what nonviolence in this. It can be depicted and understood simply by sketching out a cartoon character of Gandhi in a gag of some kind. That's all there is to it. Why, it is all like a cartoon. The whole world is like a cartoon. And simple cartoons can solve all the problems and they explain the simple truth of it all. To which I call bullshit.

I have thought for a long time that what I call cartoonism is one of the chief destructive forces in the world today. I have seen its ravaging violence firsthand. I have refused it on many occasions. I throw down this gauntlet against cartoonism itself. I am Charlie Hebdo at a level that even Charlie Hebdo would neither appreciate nor understand. Charlie Hebdo's argument with Islam is a lovers quarrel, as the new cover of the magazine shows most pointedly. It is a bloody, ugly quarrel between cartoons. One may rejoinder that Charlie Hebdo isn't going around shooting people. I am not so sure that is true. People join ranks around this issue with what is above all a massive surge of confident assumption about who is who, what is what, what is to be done, who is Charlie Hebdo, who is not Charlie Hebdo, what is right, what is wrong.

It is of nonviolence to lay open not just what occurs within an arena but the arena itself, its mis en scene, that lovely French concept, and those buried beneath such arenas.

1418417859.0,"Is something possible other than being a ""social justice warrior"" or a ""perpetual moderate""?",0,2p2pmf,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,ravia,0.46,"Obviously inspired by a [recent post here that had at social justice warriors](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalPhilosophy/comments/2oxa8h/can_we_criticize_foucault/) (SJWs), I had thought of just doing a counter post that sketched out something like ""perpetual moderates"" (PMs) or ""unflappable moderates"", partly humorous, partly serious. But that's not my real concern. Rather, I have for a long time been of the view that both ""sides"" (they are not exactly sides, which I guess I'll get into a bit) are wrong. Yet I see much greater possibility in the PMs coming to a kind of new activism that seems most needful. Who am I kidding? I know they can't get this, but I still thing that somehow they are just a teeny weensy bit closer to this basic thinking and approach.

About those ""sides"", we have to recognize that for SJWs, the ""other side"" isn't the simple or complex moderate, but the truly obvious bigot, the unreflective participant in this or that power structure, the unrepentant racist, homophobe, as well as this or that major institutional or cultural valence oriented to the systematic suppression, subjugation or marginalization of some group or basic human quality. So it's a bit hard to see the SJW as being directly opposed to the PMs who really aren't that bad, but just aren't of the personality type (I think it's worth bringing this matter of personality type in here, as someone did in the other post). True, on occasion, a SJW may view the PM as more guilty than they want to admit, and more ripe for radicalization, and therefore may be more directly opposed to a complacent attitude and lack of political alignment or posturing.

To get to it: I am quite critical of both. SJWs are so politicized that they don't realize the havoc their strong positions wreak on anyone who just isn't situated in such a manner in their lives to be able to take up their constant stream of causes. The example I've used in the past about this was what it was like to watch TV with someone who had their consciousness raised (about whatever). You might be dealing with an emotional issue and watch a TV commercial and notice the flowing hair of a model in a commercial, and use that as a tangent to think of something that is important to you. The SJW response would be to launch into a tirade about capitalism, advertising, the objectification of women (all worthy causes, I realize), while you're trying to remember an important visual image from the past, something laden with an important emotional cache. ""I was just looking at her hair, her hair reminded me of something important."" Meeting up with *zero tolerance*. 

Yet, the PM can be just as bad. If one notes a given atrocity, couched (in the US), as it usually is, in the usual institutional form (""you mean that guy was in solitary for 27 years?? that's horrific, that has to be stopped""), the PM might well say, ""look, we don't go around beheading people"". You might say, ""well, if you think about it, 27 years is on its way to a kind of soft beheading, isn't it"", and the PM might cite Pinker and note that the world is generally less violent than it was in the past, we're on our way to the end of history, etc. That guy can rot in solitary, get off your righteous kick. 

SJWs need to be much more attuned to how life actually happens, the limits of their stands, the way others aren't coming at an issue the way they are. That does not sum up the problems there by any means, btw. And PMs need to realize that some immoderate, egregious things simply must be addressed by allowing oneself to be appropriately moved to a *certain* radicalization and urgency, however inconvenient it may be to do so. That doesn't sum it all up, but it does give a sense of layout of these two ""sides"" (I'm leaving out bigoted assholes altogether for this). 

What I envision is something else, which I call ""nonviolence thoughtaction"", which involves something of the ideal suggested in the preceding paragraph: moderating politicality while making a place for truly needful radicalization. Kept in that simple form, it does seem that most of either camp are likely to fall off rather quickly. 

But that's all at a more superficial level. If one gets into ""it"", into the issues, or into the moderate push back, and if one is inclined to this ""third way"" (a term I use here *strictly* as shorthand, because the way into this ""third way"" is much more substantive and can not be accomplished with some simple math, combination and sublation/synthesis under some third umbrella that fixes everything neatly), something happens, or can happen, depending on how much one is able to think through things.

I'm going to pause here for a moment to think, and invite you to do the same. I want to keep in view a proposition: that a new activism should develop from this position, as minimal and incomplete as the above layout is. Let me suggest that it actually provides a very useful and all too stable framework for developing this other way. Yet, as I suggested, it can not be developed simply out of combination or synthesis. But in this moment of thought, we have two things to consider: what is thought about, and this idea of ""thought"", as occurring in a moment of pause. Now, maybe it's right about here that I see more hope for the PMs than the SJWs, as I think the SJWs will have little tolerance for pausing to think. This doesn't need to be fleshed out so much here. And one would think that the PMs might be a little better in this regard. Yet they, too, have their resistance to thought; it's just a bit harder to get at what that resistance actually is. It amounts, in the end, to a strong impulse to return to the comfort of their homes and lives. This can be clearly discerned in any conversation one has with them that brings them to admitting a need for radicalization at any point, or one that shows a real possibility for change, with proof of concept and everything. It's about there that a strange thing happens: the PM pans out to a nearly cosmic level, adopts a kind of sighing tone, and will invariably (*invariably*) say something like, ""well, of course such things have been around forever"", or ""well of course there are so many problems in the world"", ""in a thousand years"", ""in a better world"", etc. This is to bring about the end of the dream that is turning into a threat to them, I guess, and they want to return home.  No matter what. 

But as I said, I want to pause to thin, and to invite you to do the same. What is thinking *here*? I'll ask you first. What is thinking here? Where, here? In this progression of thought, in the context of these issues, as I've laid them out, as prompted by the previous post, etc. It's right about here (and this will turn out to be a strange kind of ""anywhere"") that I wish to begin to enjoin you to think with me. As I often find myself saying at this point, this thinking must be a bit more ""step by step"", more carefully attuned to what it is doing. This thinking, right here, already begins to take a certain flight while, at the same time wading into a certain depth. I'm getting to something, so just hold on, if you can. As we begin to flap our wings of thought, there is a danger of losing orientation, of spinning around, of launching off into any number of tangents, and, indeed, there is much freedom to do so. Here, a flight, where flight usually would seem to indicate freedom, we encounter a flight that is nearly the opposite: we set out to think in a way that requires something of us: that we review our steps, that we get an idea for where this progression is going. That we try to discern what are the real major issues in what we've engaged thus far, retaining their essence without getting lost in details or tangents. This becomes a burden (perhaps), while flight usually is thought of as losing burdens. Yet what a burden it is, really, to a winged creature to make air firm enough, through muscle and design, to provide support to lift ones body from the supporting earth. 

I will call the preceding two paragraphs an *excursis into thought as such*, that is, a momentary thinking that refreshes and invokes thought through metaphor and moment. It is rather reflective and hermeneutic, reflective because it is thinking about thinking, and hermeneutic, because it takes thought already to think about a thought that may be called for. If I hadn't made this excursis, I couldn't be sure that you would be willing or able to make the steps I'm going to make here. (LOL). But now I'm more secure in the idea. (ROTFL). Seriously. 

To wit: the founding perception here (of an inadequacy of the two positions, SJW and PM) can lead into a kind of unfolding of another way *in the heart of any position held within either position/orientation.*  This involves getting into it more deeply, more thoughtfully, as an issue is encountered or as the problem of either orientation is encountered. Or even in the absence of a compelling issue. Thus, we have the matter of *cause* (social issue), of *proponent of fighting or working for, or just the fight or work for,  the cause* (SJW) and *the resistance to that fight or work* (PM). I add the lack of a cause because some causes persist because they fail to emerge as causes, which I term ""metacrisis"".

Yet with so many elements, it should be obvious as to why we must make a kind of detour through a clarification of ""thought, as such"", rather than just proceeding. Without doing so, we will falter and fall into camps, positions, diatribes, polemics, frustration, or, of course, just ""go back home"". This seems to be asking too much; it would seem to complicate matters so much more (and they were complicated already!), but I suggest that it doesn't really complicate things all that much, that it can simplify at times, once one gets clear on what's what. *Nonreductively*, of course! To use the flight metaphor, this might be seen as reaching a height at which one may at times soar without flapping ones wings, while in terms of wading, one may begin swimming and floating. So what are our orient points? The metaphors of flight and swimming? Or the substantive matters of causes, camps and orientations? Both. 

We should like to see SJWs who lose their engagement in the logics of force, power and thought-policing because these are variously a self-crippling appraoches.At the same time, we should like to see PMs admitting that there are some causes that require real devotion, idealism, consciousness-raising and radicalism. But to attain this is another matter, hence that detour to thought and this strange inkling of a possibility of a kind of ""anywhere"" unfolding of this other way. 

This all leads to a kind of becoming. Of becoming *something*, articulated as ""a"" something. Not *a* ""social justice warrior"", not a ""perpetual moderate"", but a something else whose nomination will have to attain its meaning and clarification in the process of this ""everywhere"" unfolding. Which I have not yet exhibited here, although I've done it in countless other comments and posts here on reddit and  elsewhere. I do this *here* because I believe this is the place for it. Not in some book, but right in the midst of everyday thinking, opining, commentary, in conjunction  with causes and issues. 

To get to it, still without substantive engagement, *we must become envolutionary nonviolence thoughtaction(ists)*. This is an unfolding of nonviolence thoughtaction, which is a envolutionary (rather than revolutionary) thoughtaction (it's not simply thought or action). It's a bit in parallel to saying *we must become satyagraha*, Gandhi's term for a kind of nonviolence ""warrior"". Thought must emerge as an independent value that has its own, recurring and invoked discourse and practice, thought and action must be intersubmitted, and nonviolence must emerge as an independent value and issue. When these are accomplished, we find the following:

* In terms of SJWs: the force and power issues are submitted to the logics of nonviolence. Forcing is understood to be a poor way to enjoin others, tends to incur pushback and defensiveness, and tends to diminish a sense of shared humanity. Policing ties back into the much bemoaned police state and criminal justice system, and, moreover and perhaps most importantly, the logics of force and power end up being much to complicitous with what goes into creating a give cause (harm) in the first place. 

* In terms of PMs: leaving aside closeted conservatives and bigots (and there are a lot of these, as the other post to which this partially a response suggests), a vague sense of impossibility, of frustration with the embattled approach that really can't find its way might begin to, well, find its way out of the quagmire of realizing just how alienating some more strident positions can be, how ineffectual at times, how complicitous, etc. A lot of PMs, I thin, really would like to work harder for a better world, and do realize that some causes are really, really serious. Again, that's why I think more hope lies with PMs in this regard, but I'm not sure. And more PMs see the ""other"" as themselves, see the ""opponent"" as their family members (which they often are), and see the rich texture of life as not being so admitting of the welts whipped into the sides of life that they experience in the massive compulsions of radicalized politicization. Envolutionary (a term I have not explained) nonviolence (we didn't get into that here) thoughtaction (well didn't really get into that as such, either) provides a much better approach that could appeal to these folks. And in any case, it's the truth: the discourses on power really are crippling and often self-defeating, the creation of caricatured opponents sets up false binaries and battles, and it all does tend to lose sight of a common humanity that remains most important. In this regard, really, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was at least more on board with the true spirit of a radical nonviolence in that he really, really meant to love one's enemies. As in *love*, as in really recognizing their humanity, but at the same time taking stands, most difficult stands indeed, about issues of transcendent importance.

But what cause is this? Is it not a meta-cause? A cause, about how causes are approached and handled? Is it about any one cause? No, it is not. And that means there is no specific time or place to begin this, since we are not give to it through some sparked outrage, some signal event. On the contrary, we see, in the signal event, the crowds rushing to their various positrons, and may be given to the usual disenfranchisement with the business as usual. And yet, at the very same time, we are given to being utterly enlisted in causes that are genuinely urgent. We do not agree with PMs about how complacent we can be, or that ""nevertheless, sigh, we're on the way to a better world"". We know that posture is fully unacceptable about many issues. We find ourselves on a ground, a ground that is a setting-off point for both flight and swimming, so to speak, that emerges as three waving ""flags"": thought, action and nonviolence. 

I'd better take a little detour to stress how nonviolence is so critical here: to be clear, every single issue a SJW takes up is about a given violence, hence their commitment is pertaining to the ameliortion of violence. This is to be accomplished in some act of will and force, taking the forms (verbal and otherwise) of *battle*, struggle, pushing, force, power, criticism, negation, suppression, caricature, incarceration, even hatred and at times cruelty, but generally not direct attacks, shooting people, beheading them, etc.  *Much*, but not all, of the on-the-ground ""action"" is seen as taking the form of what is essentially weak Gandhian nonviolence (or *ahimsa satyagraha*): peaceful protests (dominant among a ""diversity of tactics"" that includes violence), sit-ins, blocking traffic, getting arrested, etc.,or just countering discourse in forums, or preventing people from speaking at all (invited speakers, etc.), or engaging in protracted theory, deconstructive analysis, critical theory, etc. Some of which works, some of which doesn't, some of which backfires and alienates people (such as the PMs, dontchya know). Because of the problems of superficial nonviolence and, more originally, the problems of violence, whether this is understood and thematized or not. Meaning that nonviolence must be given thought. Meaning that thought must be given thought. Meaning that thought must be given to understand what is essentially active about it. Meaning that action must be given to thought. Meaning that thought must be given to action. 

As one becomes more familiar with these basic orienting points in their *irreducible multiplicity*, one begins to *become nonviolence thoughtaction*. One is then able to take up causes without falling into being either a SJW or a PM. We can not possibly posit some other way of doing things that doesn't involve some process of re-orientation, change in thinking, etc. Yet we must go further and suggest that the changes *to* this orientation are not without substantive import *about given causes in the first place*. That is to say, we are engaging those causes even when taking the steps necessary for the realization of envolutionary nonviolence thoughtaction. A simpler way of putting this is that *using nonviolence* (as it is often put) about a given cause is never simply to get people to change in their position on that one cause, but is also about enjoining them into a nonviolence, where the mode of struggle is important, but where  the original cause one is addressing will have been, already, an *instance of violence* that is countered, in part, in the very mode of nonviolence-based resistance. ""There is not path to peace,peace is the path."" 

The thing to do at this point is to realize that these steps have to be gone over and over, the flight taken again and again, the wading and deepening accomplished again and again, in the midst of various issues and causes, responses to them, disenfranchisement from them,etc. This means engaging the causes and how we engage at the same time, as the best response to given causes. But the engagement, while general, is not entirely so: it does mean the emergence of thought as in independent matter, the opening, thematic and substantive development of nonviolence as such and irreducible to other things, the intersubmission of thought and action (what is *truly* active? a ton of impotent protests, or a change of mind?), and the acceptance that is a kind of ""revolutionary"" commitment whose form, owing to the passage through both thoughtaction and nonviolence, is no longer what we understand as ""revolution"", since nearly every invocation of revolution will instantiate the usual embattled positions and logics of force and power (which will invariably be at work in the given causes we are concerned about in the first place), and since the way this unfolding happens is simply better termed as something that moves in and among, steps in, unfolds out in various way, deepens and transcends, in a way that appears to be better termed as a new kind of ""revolution"", which I call ""envolution"". 

Otherwise, it's just all bitching.

1410909083.0,"The only solution to violent struggles in the Middle East: nonviolence-based revolution from within, strongly supported by the rest of the world",20,2gkd2r,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,ravia,0.73,"The only real solution for the region is to recognize the power and potential of truly nonviolence-based, secularist movements in the region. It is better to keep dictators in until such time as the masses are willing and able to carry out a full-fledged, nonviolence-based movement of national protest and strike to demand true democracy and secularism.

This requires much more than internal movements; it requires outside support. The big talking heads and power brokers around the world, as well as general communities, be they university, peace activists, ethnicity-based, etc., have to get on board with such a basic approach. This is where you see the real crisis of nonviolence, which, as we know, is hardly a crisis for anyone, which only makes it more of a crisis.

What happened in Syria is a poignant testimony to this status of nonviolence around the world today: a general narrative is available in sites of uprising, but it goes unsupported. It is attempted, as occurred in Syria, but tends to falter, then things go south to violent struggle. This also happened in Egypt, 2011, although the movement, which was truly significantly nonviolence-based, the suffered the same fate of being let go, for having been poorly grounded and supported from the start. Yet Egypt was, for Syria, a clear case of a somewhat successful nonviolence-based movement leading the way for the region. Likewise, the general progress in Tunisa has been significantly based in nonviolence and a lot of level-headed secularism. Rather than putting so much emphasis on fighting the new bad guys, the world must start to assemble another community of the willing: those willing to recognize the proof of concept that has already occurred in the Middle East and to grasp that this is what must be forwarded first and foremost.

The struggle is a kind of invisible crisis, and the crisis lies in that it is not recognized as a crisis. Few, as of yet, can do the math on this. It is not so hard to do: even in cases where nonviolence-based uprisings fail, their casualty rates are lower for obvious reasons. The smug dismissals of nonviolence, so often accompanied by the instinctive, unreflective laughter one usually associates with a what a woman hears when trying to assert herself in a male-dominated environment, are really the chief impediments here. They are everywhere. They are based on a bullet already in the air, a non plus ultra logic that menus only those cases in which a bullet has already been fired in order to dismiss the nonviolence option as unrealistic idealism. A faith in nonviolence can be shown not to be naive idealism at all fairly easily, provided people want to do this. They don't.

And it's time they started wanting to do this. They won't. So it's time those who can do the math on this at least began to raise their voices more assertively. That means you.

To see this shocking yet strangely predictable movement to yet another war, and the deep sense that this will in turn lead to yet another war in the future, and another, ad infinitum, is making many very sick and ambivalent about supporting war efforts. The anti-war factions have of course been against war all along, yet their efforts, in my view, have failed to make it to a truly robust affirmation of nonviolence-based revolution as a necessary alternative in confronting oppression and terroristic/state violence in the region. Rather, the anti-war movement has exploited polemical argument, caricature and basically bad reductions that center around the ""follow the money"" argument, utterly missing the genuine moral responsibility behind efforts such as the current one, and all the other recent Middle East adventures. As hard as it is to say, the simple fact is that these wars have not been conducted simply for oil. Today, the US is the single largest producer of oil in the world. And yet here the US is, spearheading the assembly of an international community of the willing. This is not for oil. This is because ISIS is really blood thirsty and hideously violent. True, it destabilizes the region, but were the US only concerned with oil, one could imagine that with it's Powerpoint presentations of terrorist attacks and post-Al-Qaeda acumen, ISIS would simply become the entity with whom to curry favor and trade. That is not what is happening.

ISIS is like Ebola, while the bombing approach is a bit like trying to stave its progress solely by burning the houses of the dead. Real solution lies in painstaking controls, best hygenic practices, education, careful and intensely targeted quarantine, etc. In the case of Middle East surge violence and terrorism, the solution must take place further back, not where the bullet is already in the air, and that solution is the development of truly nonviolence-based resistance in the region.

It is possible for masses of people to flood the streets as they did in Tahrir Square in Egypt. It is possible for a very large portion of the population to accept and put real faith in the narrative of success that nonioviolence-based revolution offers. It is possible to flood the region with tracts like Gene Sharps From Dictatorship to Democracy[1] , or the recent piece in Foreign Affairs, ""Drop Your Weapons""[2] . It is possible for people like President Obama to realize the basic truth of what he proclaimed in 2011: that those protesters accomplished more in 6 months than terrorists could accomplished in 50 years, and for him, especially, to realize how indebted he himself is profoundly indebted to nonviolence as it was employed in the civil rights movement, after being imported from Gandhi's nonviolence movement.

It is possible to do whatever is the nonviolence version of beating the drums for nonviolence, to fund researches, to support actual nonviolence-based entities as do in fact arise within places like Syria and Iraq.

But in the end, and in the beginning, it's really up to you to start doing the math on this and raising a voice. The world will just keep doing this over and over until you wake up and realize it has been on you the whole time.

Plain and simple. Now Kerry *et al* can just cast him as a dangerous traitor. Snowden should have made it clear that he was strongly concerned not to cause damage. True, he specified that he didn't want dangerous information leaked, but that's not the same as saying, ""I have a lot but will not release it at all, lest someone gets hurt"". To that he could have added, ""But I will say this..."" and release enough to show what the problems are.

1378361495.0,Nonviolence-based revolution should be the front line option pursed most aggressively and that is up to you,0,1lqsml,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,ravia,0.4,"To speak of nonviolence at this time would seem the height of the mere idealism to which Obama referred in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, the idealism that got him his presidency via King via Gandhi, while many are grappling with Obama's next observation from that speech: ""but there is evil in the world"". To speak of nonviolence in the midst of men and women grappling with such Serious Matters would seem the most irrelevant, hopeless idealism. And to speak of it in relation to Syria, of all places, would seem to be the height of futility. At best, an execise in idealism, perhaps noble, obviously fated to fail completely. To furthermore say that nonviolence should actually be on the table of priorities of these leaders would seem just absurd. 

But that is exactly what needs to be done. The front line site for nonviolence is Egypt. The first and second waves derived their power and success largely from their nonviolence, both in persuading and in preventing too great a resultant melee of violent reactions and fracturing of the mass will. John McCain smiled and scratched his head at the success of the first revolution in Egypt. He certainly doesn't just frown and cry in the wake of the likely gassing in Syria. No, gassing inspires him to take action. But a nonviolence-based revolution does not. Nor Obama. Such action for nonviolence would be just to ""out there"". It just is not done. It just is not really real, not realistic, not a real power, not a real option. How would it be forwarded, after all? The US has repeatedly called for protests to remain peaceful. What else could there be to do?

Now, when it comes to military action and the establishment and development of military options, the question of ""what else is there to do"" doesn't put an end to activity, expense, research, mixed and various deployments, from spies to troops to bases to basic research to stockpiling. But really. To deploy a nonviolence-based revolution initiative? To send in trainers, if not exactly spies, to meet with organizers? To study and make use of the studies available of nonviolence, as was done by some of the organizers in Egypt? And how would one stockpile nonviolence? And really, why bother, since it's not a real thing. A revolution that sees a thousand die rather than 50,000? Is that really anything to think about? It's far better, apparently, to think about a revolution in which 100,000 die, and to calculate ways of making more people die en route to staving in such a struggle.

But this idea of a practical commitment to nonviolence-based revolution is just to ""out there"", out of left field. 

Yet, Egypt could lead the way were her organizers to just push the very nonviolence they already have in their grasp a bit more, were they to make their revolution not only about democracy but about nonviolence itself. A mass movement and national strike that pushes specifically for cessation of violence as a means is possible. The realization of this exhausting repetition of violence is one step away from the realization that already occurred, that the dictatorship of Mubarak, and dictatorship itself, is just not a sensible, even tolerable idea. The historical message came in more and more due to the availability of media. The very idea of the dictator was just not something that could even float today. The Brotherhood's attempt at autocracy fell flat almost immediately and was probably the reason for the great second wave. 

The people, in short, have awakened. One eye is open: dictatorship, autocracy has go to go. The issue is that the second eye must open, and the evidence for this is *everywhere*. All these scenarios, dreadful battles, ongoing backlashes, the ""cycle of violence"" as it is called, are there just waiting for people to begin to awaken, to *open the other eye* to this basic problem of violence as a means. The iron is hot in Egypt, and Egypt could lead the way for the entire region, if her people could awaken in this way. It is not just a pipe dream. It is possible. It is necessary. I think that anyone who thinks about this seriously and without an excess of agenda can see that this is both possible and necessary, and that it requires outside support. That's where Obama and McCain and Cameron and the thoughtful of the world, the lurkers to the opinion markets of the Internet, the peace studies scholars, the scholars of history, politics, philosophy, critical theory, anarchism, you name it -- that's where they come in. The situation we stand in is one in which mobilization to this basic cause of awakening to nonviolence as a central cause, and not just preferable mode of resistance, is upon us, around the world, to take up this cause. 

There are rejoinders. Nonviolence doesn't work. But it did work in Egypt. And since when does violence, military action, violent insurrection just ""work""? Even if it failed in Syria, there would be less dead today if the movement t predominant and had been used more or less exclusively there. Even Assad had not budged by now, I challenge anyone to say that they truly believe that as many would be dead today. 

So we are left with people going around using bad rejoinders, just like the bad logics that Obama used in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. It was mere idealism, and yet Obama is the proof that it is not. McCain smiled and scratched his head, but would he mobilize to replicate that? Could he even formulate the issues of the cause? Should his inability in this regard stop us from taking up this cause? It is a cause, not only for regions of such struggle, but a cause of persuading quite directly and practically these leaders who mobilize today to bomb over the red line of chemical weapons. A cause and a responsibility as fully on the shoulders of the thoughtful as the one McCain, Kerry, Boehner, Obama and all the others calling for this intervention experience as a critical matter of genuine responsibility. 

How long until this violence begins to look as stupid as the reign of Mubarak and King George? How long until people begin doing the math, both literal and figurative, of truly engaged, well organized and supported, mass nonviolence-based revolution? Perhaps we should put such a quesiton in suspension, since the river of bodies has never really inspired the turn in question here, has it? Has it? 

And yet the mind that will give itself to this question, not merely in a general ""good will"", not in bland, ill-grounded idealism, but in a thoughtful reckoning with real facts and real possibilities can come to the dawning and awakening -- it really is something like that, I think -- that can bring one and many to say: ""wait a minute. Nonviolence-based revolution, and in a way a kind of revolution *against this violence itself* is indeed possible, and we have to get behind that. Wait a minute, King really did have to get up and *introduce* this 'new thing' of nonviolence, not as a simple and partial tactic, but as a genuine, deeply committed thing. The Egyptions really did largely succeed due to their nonviolence, and would have succeeded more were it only affirmed more, were they able finally to say 'no' to the military as well, to say, 'No, this is *about nonviolence itself*.'"" For that is the one thing they could not do. They could not say ""this is about nonviolence"". They could not say it. They did not have enough support. Because of you. They could not say it in Syria, or take the lead from Egypt. Yet.

And neither can you -- yet.

So what does it take to get you to see this? Is an explosion of water by these countless fires possible? And if it depends on you? What then?

These lynchings move far too easily, turn on superficial features, seize on misstatements and ultimately pretty well rape anyone who says something questionable in any way whatsoever.

No, I'm not going to disambiguate the sarcastic bits (above) from what my point is here. That's part of my point.

Minds kept in the simplistic and simplifying forms in which this kind of judgement can carry itself out are, interestingly enough, the sort of minds that stand ready to receive the fruits of the two great industries powering the country: capitalist materialism and retributive justice. People affirming the current backlash against Akin in this context, and especially calling for his withdrawal from his bid (and I do not believe in his politics) are ultimately casting their vote for over-simplification, seizure of superficial features (fascience), the prevailing lack of nuance and idealized terms, symbols, icons, hot buttons and various security and safety hysterias overburdening our political climate and making it quite violent. 

This dim-minded reactionism ensures a world of simplified perps in the criminal justice system, three-strikes laws, horrendous recidivism rates and Judge Judy style ""justice"". It is a tinge reaction, association based mentality incapable of making distinctions, and utterly oriented to lining up lockstep with dominating programs of social justice and propriety that have shown themselves to be bankrupt, ineffectual and on their own more destructive than the harms this kind of reactionism is geared to prevent. How many rapes occur in the US prison per year? 300,000. And outside of prison? About a third of that, by some counts. Perhaps that means *rape* rape.

1341963506.0,Pay ratio caps,6,wby3z,t5_2cneq,politics,JakOswald,0.61,"Would it work to institute pay ratio caps in the US stating that the highest paid employee and the lowest paid employee had to be within a ratio of say 100:1? That's still a really generous number for the top but what do you think it would take to create a middle class again? And I realize that if it were actually legislated that companies might try to get around it by either re-investing the money and not giving it out or rather by stipulating that employees were independent contractors and not employees. But really, what if a pay-ratio cap were instituted in the US, what benefits would it have?

From my perspective it would give more money to the middle and lower classes. Raise taxes for the government (all those wages would be taxed), and I'd say that as long as n% of the profit from the company went towards raises for employees that the corporate tax could be lowered as well for the company.

It would still come down to being an alternate tax on the rich, but one that actually benefits the middle class in a real and tangible way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wby3z/pay_ratio_caps/,12,democrats,2012-07-10 19:38:26

Might it be worthwhile to start a similar movement here targeting both National Security Agency and aspects of the Department of Defense. If those agencies do not lend themselves well to this, we could follow the Canadians example more closely and target our representatives in the House and Senate or the President. They all have Twitter accounts and email addresses where we could let them know what is going on in our daily lives as we twitter and email them about the banalities of our daily lives. Might be funny to start voluntarily CC'ing your representatives in on your daily emails and jokes since they are so interested in reading them.

tl;dr: Start CC'ing your representatives in your daily emails and twittering as an act of protest against CISPA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/sxxv9/cispa_protest_and_canadian_tellviceverything/,0,democrats,2012-04-29 11:40:15

> Unexplainable, Inexcusable 

>No one has been able to explain to me why young men... and women serve in the U.S. Military for 20 years, risking their lives protecting freedom, and only get 50% of their pay. While Politicians hold their political positions in the safe confines of the capital, protected by these same men and women, and receive full pay retirement after serving one term. It just does not make any sense. 

> On Fox news they learned that the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans. This will get national attention if other news networks will broadcast it. When you add this to the below, just where will all of it stop? 

> 35 States file lawsuit against the Federal Government

> Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon them. It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention.

> This will take less than thirty seconds to read. If you agree, please pass it on.

> This is an idea that we should address.

> For too long we have been too complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens had no idea that members of Congress could retire with the same pay after only one term, that they specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the Healthcare Reform... in all of its forms. Somehow, that doesn't seem logical. We do not have an elite that is above the law. I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. The self-serving must stop.

> If each person that receives this will post it on their wall, in three days, most people in The United States of America will have the message.. This is one proposal that really should be passed around.

> Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution: ""Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and/or Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States ..""

> Now, what are you going to do about it? Read and delete, or work for reform? Share on the wall of EVERY congressman, representative, governor, the white house!!!!! Pass it around!!! Make calls, send fax's and email's...............

Now usually I ignore stuff like this because, more often than not, it is just ignorance being displayed for the whole world to see but the part about Congressional aides not having to pay back student loans grabbed my attention so I kept reading. 

The next to last paragraph, however, is what really floored me; the proposed 28th Amendment.  It sounds like a fantastic idea to me but Im just curious as to what reddit thinks about this.  I figured if anyone could tell me whats wrong with it then you guys could.

If you don't currently listen to intelligence squared debates, you really should as the debates are almost always respectful, well thought out, and intelligent. Anyway, watch the debate if you want, otherwise, just discuss the topic.

http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/909-let-anyone-take-a-job-anywhere

I went into listening to this debate fairly firmly on the side for the resolution. I thought that the argument that open boarders would lead to greater prosperity for all, the immigrants and native born alike was extremely convincing. I found myself swinging toward the undecided category as the debate wore on. One argument I found particularly compelling was the one about how we seek to provide a certain standard of living to all Americans, and we wouldn't be able to do that with open immigration policies. I was convinced that open immigration policies were not the greatest idea when the team arguing for the resolution used Puerto Rico as an example. The aftermath of free immigration policy with Puerto Rico is scary. I mean, there was a musical (West Side Story) written about the gang violence caused by millions of low-wage immigrants being crammed into already crowded cities. I found it surprising that the most compelling argument against the resolution came from the team arguing for the resolution. 

Anyways, those were my thoughts, let's discuss yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1q7vw6/resolution_let_anyone_take_a_job_anywhere_lets/,16,democrats,2013-11-09 04:33:31

He also made the claim that ""they are holding Americans hostage."" Of course Republicans use this kind of posturing as well. The name ""Obamacare"" was at one point meant to be a Republican rallying cry and a way to vilify a piece of legislation.

What does the U.S. consider an endgame goal of China relations?,39,8sofqo,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,gadgetcool5,0.76,"Trump campaigned bashing China in virtually every speech and starts a trade war with it. Congress sanctions ZTE and Huawei in a bipartisan manner. The head of the FBI says Chinese spies are a 'whole of society threat.' CFIUS blocks Chinese investment into the U.S. The U.S. is thinking of upgrading relations with Taiwan. 

These are all moves in the recent 2-3 years. Why is this all of a sudden happening now? I understand China has a different form of government than us, an authoritarian system we don't approve of. Yet this was the same 5, 10 and 20 years ago, yet we didn't see this level of hostility to China then. Also, China has a fast growing economy that could be a competitor to the U.S. -- but again, this was true 5 and 10 years ago also, but U.S. policy wasn't as hostile to China then. If anything, China's growth rate has slowed down (and its population will go into decline in the future), so you would think they are becoming less of a threat. 

So why is all this bipartisan anti-China rhetoric coming up now? Also, what do Americans hope to achieve in the long run with respect to China?

1. He actually sounds fairly reasonable and intelligent. Very soothing also... I felt a mist of comfort projected from my TV screen and it surrounded me like a warm blanket.
2. He would not give one example of a tax rule or loophole he would change, even after repeated questioning from David Gregory.
3. On a few questions he stumbled with an answer and he came across exactly like the ""robot"" some people accuse him of being. It was as if his internal hard drive stumbled and he had to access another file for the answer. Very spooky. I wonder if there is a T-2000 Terminator under his skin.

I'm still voting for Obama but if Romney wins I don't think I'd feel the same as when Bush was president or if McCain/Palin won (i.e.: urge to move to Canada).",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zln6x/just_watched_romney_on_meet_the_press_some/,10,democrats,2012-09-09 17:38:55

I got ketchup on my blue jeans, I just burnt my hand

Lord, it's hard to be a bachelor man

I got girls that can cook, I got girls that can clean

I got girls that can do anything in between

I got to get ready, make everything right

Cause all my rowdy friends are comin over tonight


Do you want a drink, hey, do you want to party

Hey, honey, this is ole Hank, ready to get the thing started

We cooked the pig in the ground, got some beer on ice

And all my rowdy friends are comin over tonight


Now, my party pad is out in the woods

It's a long, long way from here to Hollywood

But I got some natural queens out on the floor

And ole Miss Mississippi just walked through the door

Got a little wirlpool just made for ten

And you can jump out and you can jump in

You can do anything that you wanna do

But, uh-uhh, don't you step on my cowboy boots


Do you want to drink, hey do you want to party

Hey, this is ole Hank, ready to get this summer started

I cooked a pig in the ground, we got some beer on ice

And all my rowdy friends are comin over tonight


Do you want to drink, hey, do you want to party

Hey, hey, this is rockin, Randall Hank

Ready to get the summer time started

We got some beer on ice

But I'll bet republicans and tea partiers would salivate at the thought of closing down PP so it seems like these TV commercials are doing nothing more than firing up that base. This, I am afraid, will only help Romney and could be one reason Obama looses in November.

Am I wrong about this? In my opinion Team Obama should be running commercials with Todd Aikens abortion comments and highlighting the republican platform on abortion.

1300009836.0,The Florida “Less Government = Better Government Amendment”: Would it Work?,0,g2vn5,t5_2cneq,politics,starman09,0.5,"I live in Florida, one of the states that allows its citizens to amend the state constitution by ballot initiative. I have an idea for an amendment that I think would greatly improve our state government, and perhaps those in other states as well. I'd like to solicit input from fellow redditors to see if my idea makes sense and is worth pursuing.

The idea is very simple: Florida has a state legislature that meets once a year. We also elect mayors and chairpersons in each of our cities and counties, plus our school districts. My proposal is to change our constitution so that the mayors and chairpersons of each local government perform the duties normally carried out by the legislature. Or in other words, if my amendment passed, every state legislator would be out of a job and the heads of our local elected bodies (city mayors, county and school board chairpersons) would perform their job. I think I'd call this the “Less Government = Better Government Amendment”.

It seems to me that there is a redundancy in our state government. Local officials are as aware of (if not more so) the needs and wants of their constituents so they could just as easily do the jobs of the legislators. Many are also easier to reach and talk to than the typical state legislator that only meets with huge donors. 

The benefit to citizens would be less cost since we're already paying mayors and chairpersons to govern. I also believe that we would get a better government because the new legislators would be held more accountable by their constituents and not do the bidding of lobbyists as our current legislators do.   

One aspect of this idea I have not worked out is how the new legislators would meet... would they still report to the state capitol once a year? My preferred method would be for them to discuss and vote on bills electronically via the internet.

I would really appreciate any feedback on this idea. If you see some gaping holes in the plan please explain. And if everyone thinks this idea would work then I guess I'll have to start the petition drive to get it on the ballot in 2012.

Thank you for contacting me regarding network neutrality, which is the principle that consumers should have access to the Internet content and applications of their choice without interference from network operators.  I appreciate the opportunity to hear your views on this issue. 

As a longtime advocate for network neutrality, I believe that network operators should facilitate Americans' access to the Internet.  Individuals' ability to define and shape their experiences on the Internet has led to an explosion of creativity that has greatly benefited our lives.  I am concerned that if network operators abandon the principle of network neutrality, the next generation of Internet innovators will be stifled. 

In the last Congress, I was a co-sponsor of legislation to preserve network neutrality.  Should the Senate consider similar legislation this Congress, be assured that I will support it. I am committed to ensuring that the Internet remains an engine of growth for commerce and ideas. 

Again, thank you for writing to me.  Please feel free to contact me again about any issue of importance to you.

Amendments (no. to passed bills) | 296 (121 on 36 bills) | 419 (188 on 75 bills) | 103 (32 on 11 bills) | 41 (19 on 17 bills) 

Top 5 policy areas (for sponsored bills. co-sponsored bills and amendments are on the spreadsheet): 
> Clinton: ""Health, Education, Armed Forces & Nat Sec, Taxation, Emergency Management

> Sanders: Health, Armed Forces & Nat. Sec, Labor & Employment, Finance & Financ Sector, Energy

> Cruz: Immigration, International Affairs, Health, Crime & Law Enforcement, Taxation

> Kasich: Economics & Public Finance, Government Op & Politics, Armed Forces & Nat Sec, Taxation, Social Welfare 

**Methodology** Using Congress.gov, Clinton, Sanders, Cruz, and Kasich's **Sponsored Bills, Resolutions, and Amendments** as well as Co-sponsored bills were examined to determine which passed directly to law *or were incorporated into a subsequently passed law* (as referred in the ""Notes"" section of bills""). This acknowledges that bicameral legislative process may take several forms of a bill to pass, and additionally, gives a much wider array of results than bills that directly passed to help understand issues candidates sponsored / co-sponsored. 

Data on **co-sponsored bills** made note of the bill's original sponsor (and party), the number of co-sponsors, and co-sponsored (or sponsored) bills that were strictly commemorative (congressional gold medals, renaming post offices, commemorative coins, or accepting gifts) were noted. Obviously the energy investment in co-sponsored bills is lower than sponsored bills, however, bills with fewer co-sponsors (or wherein the candidate sponsored earlier) may indicate more effort on the sake of the candidate. If you are curious about specific bills, they are all linked in the raw data [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19rAj1Jk3-BXAclWlDxpNWGgFyZH2BLz4medcFF-d4dw/pubhtml) and can be explored from there. Frequent co-sponsors (3 or more successful bills) were noted and may give some indication of Legislative allies (or ""BFFs"" since I don't know the actual term)

**Sponsored amendments** had to be investigated individually as they were not readily classed by subject area. As bills had as many as 23 amendments from one candidate, the following data were collected by subject area: Total amendments, Total laws, total passed to laws that were passed, Total laws on which amendments were proposed, Total laws which passed on which amendments were passed. Amendments were divided by subject area. Unfortunately, I was unable to get specific P/F data or specific contents on individual amendments as the mass scale of this project leant itself to more superficial analysis. 

The same methodology was applied to all four remaining candidates with legislative experience. **Donald Trump was excluded due to lacking a Congressional record** with the exception of the summary table, where biographical data was included. Career details were gathered from [votesmart.org](http://votesmart.org/), [govtrack.us](https://www.govtrack.us/about/analysis), and when those proved insufficient, candidate profiles on recognized news 

**CAVEATS** 

1. This analysis does not take into account any pre- or post- Congress actions by candidates such as Hillary Clinton's record as FLOTUS / FLOAR / Secretary of State; Cruz's legal work; Kasich's tenure as governor of OH or as OH senator in the 80s; or Sanders' time as Mayor of Burlington, VT. Again, as said, it basically does nothing for Donald Trump. 

2. I am not a political scientist, and I did this all by hand as a hobby. There are likely some errors in the links in the document or accidental omissions. But I think overall it's a pretty solid dataset. :) 

3. Ted Cruz' record may seem somewhat deficient, but we have to take into account that he's only been in the Senate since 2013. Overall, his lack of collaborators, and low amount of successful legislation linked to his name means that it's possible results can be skewed. Or, that's what being blacklisted means. 

4. Kasich seems particularly low output, but does seem to have a higher success rate. I'm not certain to what degree this reflects a functional shift in Congressional output with increased computers and the internet. However, during the period of 1992-2000 wherein they overlapped, Bernie sponsored 86 bills and 60 amendments to Kasich's 42 and 26. Bernie co-sponsored  1611 pieces to Kasich's 460. I don't think Bernie Sanders is particularly high activity, so it could indicate that Kasich is lower activity or it could indicate some combination of that, technological change, and/or the fact Kasich was a Republican opposite a Democratic President. 

When Clinton and Sanders were in the Senate together. She sponsored 363 bills to his 122; 296 amendments to his 229; 55 resolutions to his 8; though Sanders co-sponsored 2057 to her 1530 bills. 

ETA: As suggested by /u/sociotronic, I took total number of sponsored & co-sponsored bills and amendments and averaged it by years Congress. 

**Table 3. Total submitted bills and amendment averaged by years in House / Senate** 

|Candidate | Clinton | Sanders | Cruz | Kasich
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
|Sponsored / year | 45.4 | 31.2 | 17.7 | 3.8
|Amendments / year | 37 | 17.5 | 34.3 | 2.3
|Co-sponsored / year | 191.0 | 169.0 | 63.3 | 48.8

**FUN TIDBITS**

Through this analysis I learned several things

* Congress really loves voting on commemorative coins. I did not even know that was a thing prior to this.

* John Kasich sponsored 1996's [Welfare Reform](https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/3734) Bill. Yes. That one. Beyond that, Kasich signed onto a lot of tax reform bills 

* Clinton seemed very interested in internet safety for children as a Senator as well as physical health and suicide prevention. Also, she was on a few anti-meth bills. Is that a big thing in NY ~~or did she just watch Breaking Bad~~. As expected, she signed onto a lot of post-9/11, emergency management, and disaster relief bills, but also appeared to be pretty significant in post-Katrina legislation. She also signed onto a lot for foreign aid (Afghan women & children; Zimbabwe relief; etc) which made sense leading into her SoS tenure.

* Sanders had a surprising amount of legislature dealing with Parks. Perhaps that's to be expected since he's on their subcommittee, but I was surprised. His voting record on STEM is a lot better than his current campaign policies on stem--he's voted on funding for several orphan diseases, cancers, NIH's bioimaging. And then, as expected, he's done a lot for with the VA committee, and a decent bit on mortgage reform and similar types of financial policies. Sanders' wasn't too surprising. 

* Neither was Cruz. He doesn't have too much yet to speak of, but of that, he has a lot of anti-immigration stuff and basic Republican foreign policy stuff. 

* At one point I found an amendment summarized in its entirety as ""To prevent nuclear terrorism, and for other purposes.""

But I've basically tossed out my datasets to the crowd, feel free to dig through them and I hope there's something that helps with whichever candidate you're looking to support!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4glixz/legislative_analysis_of_the_remaining_candidates/,13,democrats,2016-04-27 03:02:16
1459253275.0,Trump advisor defects and pens open letters to Trump voters,5,4cdvgl,t5_2sfmf,PoliticalDiscussion,falconinthedive,0.54,"One of Trump's ""top strategists"" and former communications director Stephanie Cegielski resigned and penned a pretty scathing open letter to Trump voters. 

Highlights include: 
>It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.

>And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.

and 

>What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.

> And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.

> Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.

Is this making waves in the Republican side, or likely to (I'd guess not because Donald Trump has kind of proven teflon), but I guess I'm wondering what people here who are more involved in Republican politics, or specifically, the Trump campaign, think.

While my preliminary research has found some people arguing rallies (like Burlington, VT) are private, invite only events on private property, I've not been able to find a satisfying and definitive answer. More, rallies in places like university athletic stadiums, even if invite only, are in publicly-owned venues (like Valdosta State).

It seems to me that this would violate freedom of assembly or the Civil Rights Act of 1964 if they are in fact being removed from public *or private* venues based on race. And even if Trump doesn't directly order harassment, that tolerating it and not removing the attackers would leave Trump (or at least someone official) open to some legal action.

1300157728.0,A possible path to break through the two-party system in the US?,2,g3uhz,t5_2cneq,politics,ultralame,0.75,"The argument is pretty solid- trying to gain support for a true third party in the US is difficult because a) the system is winner take all and b) any vote for a third party tends to act as an effective vote for the party you like even less.

But what about a third party that didn't worry so much about getting their own candidate elected as much as acting as a voting block?

Michael Moore talked about his disappointment with Nader in 2000; he mentioned how as the election geared up, Nader could have thrown his support to Gore in exchange for promises from him that the Green party would have liked to see.

But what if Nader had said ""Gore, Bush, here's the deal...  The first one of you who publicly promises to do X, Y and Z gets the Green vote.  No BS.  Gore, you promise to legalize pot and you're president.  Bush, you promise to raise taxes on the top 5% an you are president.  Let the bidding war start now.""

The size of the Nader voting block would have more than made up for any number of people who would have jumped ship if those two would have taken the bait.  And in that close election, they both would have done it in the last few days.

Now, this wouldn't thrust a third party into the White House, but it certainly would show people that a third party isn't a fringe/insane thing.  And even if you end up voting for the other guy, your vote isn't thrown away- you are using it to change the political landscape for the better.

Granted, there would have to be consequences.  If Gore didn't keep his promise, the Greens would have to vote R in the 2002 midterms, etc.  This could not be a one-time push (like Perot's party).

But it would start the ball rolling, and legitimize the idea of a third party *without* throwing your vote away.  What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/g3uhz/a_possible_path_to_break_through_the_twoparty/,2,democrats,2011-03-14 22:55:28
1275703742.0,"I wrote a letter to my reps in congress in support of Net Neutrality.  Here is the positive response from my Rep, Jackie Speier (D-CA, 12th; SF and San Mateo) (Yes, the same one shot at Jonestown)",2,cbi8c,t5_2cneq,politics,ultralame,0.75,"Dear Mr. XXXXXXXXXX:

 

Thank you for writing me in support of H.R. 3458, the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, which would protect the Internet from blocking, censorship and discrimination by cable and telecommunications companies.  I agree with you: we must preserve a neutral Internet and open network access for everyday users.  I continue to support this important net neutrality legislation.

 

H.R. 3458 would mandate a series of public hearings around the country to ensure the American public, not private interests, shapes the conversation on the future of the Internet.  Furthermore, the bill would codify basic non-interference and nondiscrimination policy for broadband, to protect the rights of consumers and safeguard an open marketplace of ideas on the Internet.

 

As a Representative from the Bay Area and a neighbor to Silicon Valley, I am acutely aware of how the Internet has revolutionized our economy and re-shaped our everyday lives.  Since its inception, the Internet has depended upon the ability of people to connect with one another without facing discrimination in service or degradation of their ability to access the full diversity of content and programming that the World Wide Web has produced.  Attempts to divide consumer broadband service into fast and slow toll lanes for increased profit are unacceptable.  Such attempts would allow cable and telecommunications companies to consolidate unreasonable control over preferred content and would surely diminish the capacity for new minds to break through content chokepoints and bring their ideas and innovation to market.  I will fight any efforts to block a free-flowing Internet.  Please know that I will continue to keep your thoughts and concerns in mind as Congress debates future telecommunications policy.

 

Thank you again for taking the time to write me about this issue.  I value the letters I receive from my constituents and use them to better inform my decision making process.  I hope you will write me in future on matters important to you. 


All the best,
 
Jackie Speier

* Is it by the candidate's campaign? 

* Is it by their Party's National Committee? 

* Is it by a super PAC, 

* or by a $2700 max PAC? 

* Is it by another organization? Does that candidate endorse the organizations action as a whole, or their ad? Did they never endorse?

* Finally, did it actually air? Just give one example of where it aired. Don't post extended versions that never saw air times.

If they in any way vote against our interests they will be out of office. There needs to be primary challengers ready in each house and senate race.

1. We must have congressional watchdog groups. This means following up on what they are voting on as well as their past record. Get as much information on them as possible.

2. We must have a list of what we want and tell our politicians to support and vote on them. 

3. If they don't do what we want them to do vote them out. This doesn't necessarily mean vote for the other party it means run primaries and find the candidates to run in those primaries. The candidates that support our views.

4. We have to get money out of politics. It is the biggest problem our country faces. Every issue we face has to do with money in politics. The candidate that wins ans usually the one with the most money. We need a level playing field were there is a cap on campaign financing. 

5. Many politicians who leave office work as lobbyists (defense contractors, banks, oil companies, etc). We must fight to change this. If you leave office you are banned from working those companies for 10 years.

Republicans are all about stamping out this nonexistent (statistically speaking) voter fraud.

It's called indelible ink. Walk in, vote (method is fluid, electronic, handwritten, ink-blot, punch-card, doesn't matter) then mark everyone when they hand over the ballot. Like a mark across the forehead (think Ash Wednesday). 

I know this may sound crazy but it really fixes the problem. It's like the  ""I voted"" button, but it lasts a couple days. Can't really hide it, and ensure people don't vote more than once. You walk in with the specifically colored ink, you have already voted. 

Now, I realize that nothing is foolproof, and that abuse potential exists, but it's a hell of a lot less than ID's and it doesn't amount to a poll tax.
